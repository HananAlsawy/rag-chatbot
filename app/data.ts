      '\nThe Devil in the Shape of a Woman\nby Carol Karlsen\nReviewed by Mathew Madden\n\nSalem Witch Trials in History and Literature\nAn Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia\nSpring Semester 2001\n\n\nThe Devil in the Shape of a Woman by Carol Karlsen (1987) astutely focuses attention upon the female as witch in colonial New England, thus allowing a discussion of broader themes regarding the role and position of women in Puritan society. Karlsen\'s work, which has been well-received, focuses on the position of accused witches as largely females placed in precarious social and economic positions, often because they stood to inherit, had inherited, or lost an inheritance in property. Karlsen departs from the idea that women accused of witchcraft were boisterous beggars, a depiction "tantamount to blaming the victim" (Nissenbaum) and instead points to these "inheriting women" as being socially vulnerable in a patriarchal culture.\n\nKarlsen\'s work is not merely of historical significance to the Salem outbreak of 1692. In fact, "that year remains something of an anomaly" (Nissenbaum) as one-third of the accused witches then were male compared to less than one-fifth of accusations made otherwise in colonial New England. Instead, Karlsen\'s study brings "women strongly back to center stage, locating them in a rich patriarchal matrix that integrates it with class and family." (Nissenbaum). One reviewer notes that within this context, Karlsen offers significant insights. The first is a look at the "ambivalent assessment of women within New England\'s culture." (Gildrie). Karlsen finds a scenario marked by its time and place in which women embodied the "Puritan ideal of women as virtuous helpmeets" (Boyer). In an odd duality, women were both the new stewards of God\'s spiritual leadership on earth, while subservient to a Medieval, misogynist gender role which largely placed their fate at the hands of men.\n\nSecondly, Karlsen focuses attention on the accusers and finds that they were engaged in a "fierce negotiation... about the legitimacy of female discontent, resentment, and anger." (Karlsen; see Gildrie). Accusations of witchcraft were often an outlet where this negotiation boiled over into violence, as men persecuted female neighbors who threatened an established, but precarious, social order. The crucial thesis on which much of the book rests is that witchcraft accusations were most often made against women who threatened the orderly transfer of land from father to son - a process at best fraught with tension and anxiety and at worst marked by the shift of scarce, valuable properties from one family to another by way of an intervening woman in a patriarchal inheritance system. The possessed girls played a dual role in this "symbolic cultural drama" in which they rebelled against the social role to which they had been predestined at birth by simultaneously acquiescing in that role by resisting the "witch."\n\n\nIf nothing else, Karlsen\'s recent work proves that there is still room for substantial study and scholarship surrounding witchcraft, gender, and other issues in colonial New England. One commentator writes, "Karlsen\'s study is provocative, wide-ranging, accessible, and frank." (Lindholt). Another, that the book\'s "descriptions and analyses stand on their own as valuable contributions to our knowledge of witch lore and the ambiguous status of women in early New England." (Gildrie). Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum, whose Salem Possessed set the standard for social histories of the outbreak in Salem, find that Karlsen\'s work is one of "formidable intellectual power" and "a major contribution to the study of New England witchcraft." It places the central role of women as witches under the microscope and "for the first time as the subject of systemic analysis" a considerable 300 years after the events transpired. Karlsen\'s work is required reading for the student, scholar, or general reader seeking to understand and interpret the broad picture of colonial witchcraft in New England.\n\nBack to Scholarship\n\nReferences:\n\nPaul Boyer.

      '\nThe Salem News\nThursday, April 01, 2004\n\nOnline records become valuable tool for historians and genealogists\nThe Original Court Log\n\nSALEM - Some of the most fascinating ar eas of the Salem Witch Trials Documentary Archive have nothing to do with the hysteria of 1692. Probate records, for example, provide an amazing window into everyday life in the Massachu setts Bay Colony, with meticulous lists of household items, from land to furnishings to the contents of the kitchen cupboard.  \n\nLikewise, the records are a boon to the most active users of Salem\'s Phillips Library -- genealogists.\n\nBetter yet, anyone with an In ternet connection can reach all this at www.salemwitchtrials.org.\n\nSite creator Benjamin Ray of the University of Virginia can\'t hide his enthusiasm when he discusses the court records of Essex County, volumes going back to 1636. He points out that 20th century archivists at the Phillips Library did yeoman\'s work in laboriously cataloging what\'s offered.\n\n"What   we\'re doing is leveraging work done at the Essex Institute," he says.\n\nThe site\'s index alone is a treat to read. For example, in the period from 1636 to 1656 a list of crimes includes such remarkable accusa tions as "careless grinding and toll taking," "kissing," "meddling," "lust" "wearing silver lace\ncontrary to God," and "uncharitable ness to a poor man in distress."\n\nSometimes the crimes are not as exotic as the charge might indicate, and a simple mouse click can take you right to the actual language of the documents\n\nWhile the recordreads, "Jonathan Platt indevoring to drawe away the afections of m. Rogers, his mayd is Judged to haue broken the law and is fined," without the consent of friends."\n  The ledgers show the Puritan concern for propriety, but they seem eager as well to set things right in the end, as when, "Math ew Stanley and Ruth Andrewes fined 50s or to be whipped for for nication, but the fine to be remit ted if they marry together."\nSome of the entries are poignant, leaving the reader with haunting questions:\n\n"Mary Bidgood was required to appear for not repairing to her husband in England. Neighbors testified that he could not maintain her, nor did he require her to come to him, and by his letters had left her to herself and her friends here. She was permitted to remain for the present and \'to see what the pvydence of god may lead unto afterward.\'"\n\nEstablishing an American tradi tion, debt is the most common crime, with more than 100 entries.\n\nDrunkenness is also a frequent charge, a fact perhaps not unrelated to numerous citations for slander and defamation, a serious matter to a people who very much saw the value of a good name.\n\nBack to Salem Press Archive\n\n ',

      "\nHome\nArchives\nBooks & Letters\nDocuments\nMaps\nPeople\n\nThe Salem Witch Trials Digital Archive: How and Why\n\nBenjamin Ray\n\nUniversity of Virginia\n\n(Published in Arkiv Information Teknik, No 1 2022)\n\nThe Salem witch trials began in late February, 1692 and lasted until the end of May 1693. The accusations spread across twenty-four communities in eastern Massachusetts Bay Province. At least 155 people were arrested and jailed, thirty were convicted, nineteen were executed by hanging, one man was crushed to death with stones, and five more died in prison due to harsh conditions. Compared to the large seventeenth century European witch-hunts the Salem episode was a small scale tragedy. But it was the worst witch-hunt in American history. In October 1692, Governor William Phips ended the special Court of Oyer and Terminer in Salem. In January, the new Superior Court of Judicature began to try the remaining cases for the purpose of clearing the jails. During the Salem trials, more people were accused and executed than in all the previous witchcraft trials in New England. After Salem trials, no one was convicted of witchcraft in New England. The Salem debacle eventually led to the collapse of the Puritan government in Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1999, as a faculty member of the department of Religious Studies at the University of Virginia, I started to create a web-based archive of primary source materials relating to the Salem witch trials in order to teach a new seminar for Religious Studies majors. The seminar would use scholarly studies as well as the primary sources, especially the Salem court records, about 950 documents. These sources would enable the students to not only learn about a new subject but also engage in evaluating different methodologies that scholars use to interpret it, for example, sociology, theology, history, psychology, and comparative religions. I chose the Salem episode purposely without knowing much about it. I wanted to be fresh to the subject without any preconceived ideas. I knew that many of the students would be somewhat familiar with the Salem tragedy because of the popularity of Arthur Miller's play The Crucible, which is widely taught in American high schools. At the time I was unaware that I had a personal connection to it.\n\nSince the students would need to regularly consult the court records in their work and since there was only one copy of the most recent but now out of print compilation the three volume publication The Salem Witchcraft Papers, edited by Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum, 1977(hereafter, SWP), it was necessary to provide maximum availability of these volumes. The simple solution was to digitize the volumes with the publisher's permission, and put them online at the University's new Electronic Text Center, created by its founding director David Seaman. I received a small grant for this purpose, and the three volumes were accurately keyboarded in India.\n\nI was also fortunate to collaborate with Professor Bernard Rosenthal of the English Department at SUNY Binghamton, N.Y. who was looking for a partner to create a digital archive of Salem court records in order to assist his international team of scholars who were going to create a new transcription of the 1692-93 court records for a print publication, Records of the Salem Witch-Hunt (Cambridge, 2009). There were many mistakes in SWP, which incorporated the transcriptions made in in 1938 as part of the WPA program. There were occasional missing words and sentences, and mix up of documents between people with the same last names. Despite these errors, Rosenthal's team needed to consult the transcriptions as a baseline standard. The transcribers were located in the United States and Scandinavia, and they also needed to work with the original manuscripts, without the logistical problems of working primarily in the archives. Digitization of the original manuscripts was the solution.\n\nThe manuscripts were held in several Boston area archives, principal among them the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem and the Massachusetts State Archives in Boston. Later, thanks to several substantial research grants from NEH, the American Academy of Religion, and the Institute of Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) at the University, headed by its founding director John Unsworth, I was able to develop the digital Archive further by placing document images next to the transcriptions on each web page. IATH was also able to develop various search tools and digitize several out-of-copyright books and newly discovered court records to enhance higher level scholarly research. My aim was for the site to be used by advanced scholars as well as high school and university teachers and students and also the general public. To accommodate such a wide range of users it was necessary to spend a good deal of time planning the site's design and functionality so it would be as easy to navigate its textual, manuscript, image and geographical resources.\n\nIn the course of teaching the seminar, I discovered that four of my ancestors were directly involved as defenders of one of the accused. The family name was then spelled Rea, and two married couples signed a substantial document in defense of the victimized seventy-one-year-old Salem Village resident Rebecca Nurse. Unfortunately, like other defense efforts, the petition testifying to Nurse's exemplary Christian character had no effect on the court's decisions, and Nurse was convicted and executed. One frightened twelve-year-old named Jemima Rea, whose parents had defended Nurse, accused Nurse of bewitching her. Fortunately, Jemima's accusations were not deemed worthy of legal attention, and they were not used by the prosecution.\n\nAfter learning of my family's involvement, my goal was to enable as many voices as possible of the people involved to be heard: those of the accusers, defendants, their family members, husbands and wives and children, confessors, magistrates, jury men, ministers, sheriffs, constables, and jail keepers. Altogether there are over 1,400 names in the court records. For this reason, the site also serves as an useful genealogical resource, and all the names are searchable in all of the records.\n\nSome of the Boston area archives were initially hesitant about letting me scan their witch trial manuscripts which are among the most valuable in their collections. Once I was asked what would happen to the document images once they are 'out there' for anyone to download. \"Might someone print them on coffee mugs as souvenirs?\" But once the distinguished Massachusetts Historical Society gave me permission to digitize their small collection, I was able to use the MHS's example to open doors to other Boston archives. Of course, the archives also realized that digitization would assist with their goals of preservation and access.\n\nIn addition to digitizing the SWP my more interesting job as part of Rosenthal's team was to go into the Boston area archives and locate all the original manuscripts of the court records and digitize as many as possible and put them online together with the transcriptions from the SWP. In the process Margo Burns, Rosenthal's project manager, and I located over seventy previously unidentified documents and added them to the corpus of documents.\n\nThe court records in the SWP were organized alphabetically according to the names of the accused individuals, each person having their own case file of court records. Following English criminal law, since the trials were under the authority of the state (not the church), the documents represented all the stages of the legal process: complaints, arrest warrants, summonses, records of preliminary hearings, grand jury hearings, indictments, trials, and sentences. The records of the trials of the thirty individuals who were found guilty and convicted in 1692 are missing, some believe to protect the reputations of the various judges.\n\nBut about 90 percent of the other records survive, and they were used in all stages of the legal process. The SWP is organized around 140 case files of accused individuals, many more accused people are involved in these cases, altogether about 155 individuals. The case files cover proceedings of 1692-3 as well as some records extending through 1750.\n\nIn 2000 I was appointed a Research Fellow of the University's new Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities, then headed by John Unsworth, and this enabled the project to be developed further.\n\nOne of the problems for researchers was that about half the court records are undated and hence not retrievable by date which is critical for historical study. Thanks to Rosenthal's work, dates and searchable date tags could be assigned to each of them. Nor were the names of the individuals searchable across all the case files. This being the late 17th century, many of the 1,400 personal names were not spelled consistently. The solution was to create a standardized index of names and searchable name tags. It was also necessary to create a word search tool, linked to the date tags. This would enable the tracing of all words and document types across time and make it possible to follow them through the course of the legal process.\n\nFinding patterns in this large number of documents would be one of the site's key functions, patterns that are chronological or reveal how the role that certain people played out over time, or follow the patterns of the legal process. For example, all those who falsely confessed to acts of witchcraft were required to estimate the size of the threat to the village ministry because the Salem Village church was the focus of Satan's attack. According to one informant, \"Satan's design was to set up his own worship, abolish all the churches in the land, to fall next upon Salem and so go through the country.\" Satan's aim was to defeat Christian worship in the village and replace it with Satanism. Indeed, a search of the records turned up the fact that confessors gradually increased the number of spectral witches they \"saw\" holding demonic rituals opposite the minister's house in order to reinforce their confessions, which would save them from trial, one of the oddities of the Salem court. Key word searches turned up dozens of reports of these Satanic rituals next to the minister's house in Salem Village which had driven the court's witch-hunt relentlessly forward. For the first time, the allegedly growing size of the threat and the lengthy legal process could be documented over time and identify the people who were responsible for it.\n\nIt was also necessary to digitize several extremely rare 17th century books that dealt with the witch trials and were held in the University library's department of Special Collections. We also digitized a well-known 19th century works, and a most valuable early 20th century abridged edition of these book that was out of copyright which was keyboarded and put on line. There were also 9 volumes of court records for Essex County where the Salem accusations occurred from 1636-1686. Among the most valuable sources is the ?Church Book Belonging to Salem Village? of 1692-3 written by the aggressive witch-hunter pastor of Salem Village, the Reverend Samuel Parris. This was digitized and transcribed in electronic text.\n\nOther important resources were geographic maps of the town of Salem in 1700, a separate map Salem Village in 1692, and a map of the house locations of 17th century Andover. These three communities held a large number of accusers and accused victims. Images of these maps were digitized as part of the Archive. Most important in all this was the creation of a dynamic mapshowing the spread of the witchcraft accusations from their epicenter in Salem Village across 23 other towns, starting in February 29 and running through into February 1693. This map would give the students a sense of the chronological and geographic process, showing the locations of the 151 people accused and giving a sense of how the accusations spread across Essex county in geographic space. It is the only map of its kind based on the dates, and locations of the accusers in the court records.\n\nOne of my main priorities was to make the Archive's web interface as transparent as possible so it could be navigated by any user, thus all the contents are listed on the entry page, under major headings: records of various courts, church record books, historical maps, contemporary books, literary works, selected short essays by undergraduates in the years 2000-2002, together with press reviews of the web site.\n\nWhat happened, then, to Rebecca Nurse? One of the most interesting documents in her case is the Petition on behalf of seventy-one-year-old Nurse, who was the fifth person to be accused. Her two sisters were also accused and one of them, Mary Esty, was executed. The accusations against the sisters were based on a conflict over a property boundary with the large and influential Putnam family, some of whom also signed the petition for her. On this document there are the signatures of 39 of her neighbors. All are individual signatures which suggests that the document was taken from house to house. Such petitions, however, had no standing in court because they were not sworn to, lest they be untrue and endanger the signer's soul. In Rebecca's case, the jury returned a verdict of innocent, but were told to continue their deliberations because Nurse's responses to the judges questions were not always clear. After further deliberations the jury returned a guilty verdict and Nurse was later executed. Her Death Warrant still survives. In the aftermath her family members took her half-buried body from Gallows Hill during the following night back to her home for burial on the grounds the Nurse homestead which is fortunately preserved today as a tourist attraction.\n\nSalem's long suppression of the memory of its brutal witch-hunt resulted in the loss of the knowledge of the location of the execution site. As part of a team of five scholars from various disciplines, I worked with the GIS department at the University using view shed analysis to help confirm its historic location based on the early twentieth century work of local historian Sidney Perley. The site was recently commemorated in 2017 by the city of Salem with a memorial. It is rare that historians, using digital technology, can help change how and where events can be studied and remembered, and indeed be suitably memorialized.\n\nHome | Project Overview | Press Archive\n\n© Copyright 2002 by Benjamin Ray and The Rector and Visitors of the\nUniversity of Virginia",

      "\nHome\nArchives\nBooks & Letters\nDocuments\nMaps\nPeople\n\nOverview of the Salem Witch Trials\n\nBrief Account\n\nThe Salem witchcraft events began in late February 1692 and lasted through April, 1693. All told, at least twenty-five people died: nineteen were executed by hanging, one was tortured to death, and at least five died in jail due to harsh conditions. Over 160 people were accused of witchcraft, most were jailed, and many deprived of property and legal rights. Accused persons lived in the town of Salem and Salem Village (now Danvers) and in two dozen other towns in eastern Massachusetts Bay Colony. Nearly fifty people confessed to witchcraft, most to save themselves from immediate trial. Hundreds of other people in the Bay Colony -- neighbors, relatives, jurors, ministers, and magistrates -- were caught up in the legal proceedings of the trials. In October 1692, Governor William Phips ended the special witchcraft court in Salem. Accusations soon abated and eventually stopped. In January, the new Superior Court of Judicature began to try the remaining cases and eventually cleared the jails. After Salem trials, no one was convicted of witchcraft in New England. During the Salem trials, more people were accused and executed than in all the previous witchcraft trials in New England.\n\nFurther Explanation\n\n\nHome | Introduction | Press Archive\n\n© Copyright 2002 by Benjamin Ray and The Rector and Visitors of the\nUniversity of Virginia\n",

The Old Style calendar date for this sermon is 19 September, 1689]\n\nHow Blessed of God are all you, wo having been at ye Lords table, have had communion with ye Lord at his Table. The Lord bless you, & keep you. The Lord make his face shine upon you, & be gracious unto you. The Lord lift up his countenance upon you, & give you Peace. And the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you yt w'ich is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be Glory for ever & ever. Amen.\n\npage: 1\nMy poor & weak Ordination sermon at the Embodying of a Church in Salem Village on the 19.9.1689. The Rev'd Mr. Nicholas Noyse Embodying of us: wo also Ordained my most unworthy Self Pastor, & together with the Rev'd Mr. Sam: Phillips & the Rev'd Mr. John Hale imposed hands The same Mr. Phillips giving me ye right hand of fellowship with beautifull loveliness & humility.\n\n5 Joshua 9· first part\n\nAnd the Lord said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the Reproach of Egypt from off you. As to the Penman of this Book there are variety of apprehensions but famous Calvin, & some others, suspend their determinate judgments about it as not having sufficient grounds to bottom any certainty upon.\n\nThe Scope of this Book is of great excellency & usefullness upon sundry accounts. As\n\n1. To discover to us the sufficiency of a divine promise for Faith to build upon, & (as I may say) rest it self in. God for many years before had promised to give Abraham & his Seed ye Land of Canaan but in the interim he seems (as it were) to have forgotten yt Promise. But yet in his own good & promised time, he doth most punctually notwithstanding all intervening difficulties, seeming impossibilities, & naturally reall invincible impediments fully perform every part of that promise. Hince then all true Israelites have enough to stay upon in all ages as long as they have a Divine promise to build & bottom upon.\n\n2. To discover to us the sufficiency of a divine threatening to strike terrour into Heavens Rebells. God had threatened ye Canaanites for their Idolatry & other wickednesses that he would root them out of the earth, & give their Land\n\npage: 2\nto another & a better people: but this threatning was long delayed before it was brought unto execution: & very likely ye carnall Canaanites thought it altogether impossible. Well but at length w'th those wo were to cut them off drew near, & impediments were miraculously removed, namely Jordan driven back, so as to give way to the Israelites dry passage, as soon as ever the Priests wo bare the Ark were dipped in the brim of the water: now these poor cursed Canaanites tremble. 5. Chap. 1. And this doctrine, or lesson, is exceeding usefull for our unbelieving dayes. Alas! unless there be a present fulfilling of an evil threatned many, too many, will little regard it. What the wise man saith is sadly applicable to multitudes in our dayes. 8. Eccl. 11. Because sentence against an evil work – sinners see no hell, & therefore they fear none. Oh Sinners! time enough, time enough, have but a little patience, & you shall see an hell time enough, wrath will overtake you time enough, if you prevent it not by true Repentance.\n\n3. To discover to us the true, & most shining ornaments of a good Ruler whither in Church, or Commonwealth, namely that he be endued with true piety, prudence, valour, diligence, patience &c as Joshua here. Such a one should have his eyes so fastened upon Religion as no Basilisk should remove them. Such a one should be so much for the advancement of Gods pure worship that he should resolve to carry it on as far as he can, when he cannot carry it as far as he would, & tho he cannot get one soul from abroad to joyn with him in it. 24 Josh. 15.\n\n4.To discover to us the very best way for the attaining of a flourishing Common wealth. Many very anxiously have disputed about this point, but the unerring word page: 3 of God, in that book & elsewhere, & also experience gives full proof that there is no readier way to prosperity than to walk heedfully in the paths of piety. New-England knows this very well to be true.\n\n5. To discover to us ye spiritual conduct Gods true Israel have by Christ Jesus through the Wilderness of this world into the other Canaan, that blessed land far off. Joshua both in name & deeds was a type of Christ Jesus. Joshua must convey Israel through the swellings of Jordan & put them into a peaceable possession of Canaan, the promised typical Rest. In all which ws typified what Christ Jesus doth for believers.\n\n6. Last. To discover to us what Xtians mist look for whilst they appertain to the Church Militant, & so are war hours under the Lord Jesus: namely laborious & hazardous combats both public and private till they are are brought to the Rest above\n\nBut so much for the several general usefull instructions this book offers us.\nIn this book of Joshua is described\nThe history of Joshua’s Life [and] Death\n\nJoshua’s life is set for principally in reference to ye great office committed to him of being chief Governor over Israel to conduct them into the promised land after Moses’s death.\n\nTouching this his Office two things are observable\n\n1. His vocation to his Office 1. Chapt. Wherein you find God Commanding him to who work, instructing him in it, & encouraging him to go about it 2. His administration, or Execution, of this his Office, & that both in times of War & Peace\nIn time of peace after his conquest, by his distributing the conquered land,\n\n\n& appointing cities of refuge, & laying out forty & eight cities for the Levites, all which were done according to Gods fore appointing & commandment.\nIn time of war we have an account or narrative of his prudent, valiant, & martial acts for dispossessing and destroying of the Canaanites. As\n\n1. His Commanding the people by their officers to make ready for their passing over the River Jordan. 1. Cap. 10. 10. v.\n\n2. His Reminding the two tribes & a half (whose Lot was assigned them on this side of Jordan) of their engagement to Moses to help their Brethren, in the war till the Lord had given them Rest: whereunto is annexed their profession of Obedience unto Joshua. 12. v. ad finem.\n\n3. His sending, or dispatching, of two Spies to view the Land who being received & entertained by Rahab do therefore Covenant with her by oaths to save her, & her household, & who at their return make a faithful & encouraging report unto their General Joshua. 2. Cap. totu To adnomine\n\n4. Last: His, & all Israels, miraculous passage through ye River Jordan. 3. & 4. Cap.\n\nAnd so we come to this 5th Cap. wherein instead of many things (for brevity’s sake) we may take notice of two. As\n\n1. Of wonderful terror which fell upon the Canaanitish Kings upon Israel’s thus\nover the River Jordan 5. Cap.1. God had long before threatened them with destroying judgments but they trusting in their own strength were secure & slighted divine threatenings. But now when they understand that the enemie had passed over Jordan their hearts melted. i.e. their wisdom, valour. & the like failed them.\n\nJordan was their great Bulwark: a defense to their whole Country, & therefore they feared little. They page: 5heard no doubt of Israels prodigious traveling thro ye Red Sea. I but yt was a great while agoe. & besides very far from them, therefore this terrified ym not, or else time had eaten up yt terror. I but now the like is done near themselves, & mining enemies are upon their very banks, at the presence of whom their very Bulwark Jordan as affrighted gives way, & this strikes terrour into their sinfull souls. What ye holy Ghost sais 20. Job. 22. of the oppressor is many times fulfilled, & particularly here. In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straights. When wicked men think themselves most secure many times they are most in danger. As here ye Canaanites never dreamt of any Invasion this way, on this side their Countrey because it was their strongest post but lo here they are invaded, & their defense opens to the enemy, this strikes terrour into them.\n\n2. Of Joshua's renewing Circumcision 2-10 verse. Concerning w'ch we may take notice of two things: namely the Causes & the Consequents thereof.\n\nI. The causes ofJoshua's circumcising ye children of Israel: & they are two, namely Gods command, & ye Peoples former omission.\n\nI. Gods command 2. v. therefore he dos it in ye 3rd verse.\n\nQuest. But it may be asked w't is meant by circumcising ye Second time mentioned in the 2 verse.\n\nAnsw: Only in a very few words (though there are wo do considerably controvert about it) It is not meant by the second time, yt those wo were already circumcised should again be circumcised, which is inconsistent both with Religion & Nature. Seing yt could not be cut off again which was cut off before. But the meaning is page: 6restore the Sacrament of Circumcision, to its primitive use as ye first institution of it to Abraham & his seed w'ch now for a long time had been neglected, or at least omitted, if not during their abode in Egypt, yet during their travel in the wilderness. So that not the same individual person is commanded to be circumcised, who was before circumcised, but the same people who were at first circumcised in their Parents, is now commanded to be circumcised in their children.\n\n2. The peoples omission of this duty & ordinance before as you read in the 4. 5. 6. 7. verses.\n\nII. Now follows to be taken notice of ye consequents of Joshua's circumcising the Israelites. Namely\n\n1. Their forbearing to prosecute their Enemies ye Canaanites. 8. v. The reason was because of their present inability for war as appears in the instance of the Shechemites. 34. Gen. 25. And it is worthy our noting what a notable advantage ye Canaanites now had for doubtless they had spies abroad wo could tell them what was doing among the Israelites, I but God overawed them. Obedience to God is the best defense against the greatest hazards. 34. Exod. 23. 24·\n\n2. Gods speech to Joshua hereupon. Text. And the Lord said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away ye Reproach of Egypt from off you. In this speech to be short we may take notice of these following things. Viz.\n\nI. God tells us the an Evil was removed, namely ye evil of Reproach. Reproach, contempt, disgrace &c w'ch are synonomous words every one will readily own to be an Evil. Well sais God this Evil is removed, or rolled away.\n\n2. God tells us the kind or quality of this Evil or Reproach namely the Reproach of Egypt. Not a bare & naked Reproach, but a grand Reproach, a very foul Reproach indeed: the Reproach of Egypt. i.e. yt being uncircumcised they were like the Egyptians, namely profane\n\npage: 7\n& strangers unto God, not being interested in his coven't w'ch is a very great shame, obloquie & Reproach to any person or people as is by & by to be hinted\n\n3. God tells us which removed this Evil, namely he himself\n\n4· God tells us fro whom this Evil was removed, namely Israel. I have rolled away the Reproach of Egypt from off you.\n\n5. God tells us how he removed it, namely, by rolling it away. Now by rolling away a Reproach dos not mean only the removal of contempt disgrace & infamie but also the bestowing honour & dignity upon such: as 119. Ps. 22. Remove from me Reproach & contempt. Not as if the Psalmist aimed at nothing else in his Prayer but the removal of Reproach, but also at promotion & dignity namely that God would so shine upon him as that those who would be glad to Reproach & contemn him might not by providence be favoured w'th any advantage so to do: but that he might be above the contempt of his wicked adversaries\n\n6.Last. God tells us ye time when, the very day wherein he removed this evil from them, & so consequently & implicitely ye way whereby he did remove this evil from them, namely, by admitting ym into covenant w'th himself, & confirming it unto them by his Seals the Sacraments; Circumcision mentioned in ye former verses & ye Passover mentioned in the verse following ye text.\n\nDoctr. It is an Egyptian-like disgrace & Reproach to any people to be out of visible & Sacramental communion with God in his Ordinances, w'ch Ordinances when God doth gratiously bring a people to the enjoyment of, then, & thereby, God doth not only take away their former disgrace & Reproach, but also most highly exalt promote, & dignify them.\n\n1.Prop: Vide pag. 8 latter part * It is an Egyptian-like disgrace & Reproach to be out of visible & Sacramentall communion with God in his Ordinances.\n\npage: 8\nIf you say how may this appear\n\n1. An: From the blessed Gods account. Text. And the Lord said unto Joshua This day, have I rolled away the Reproach of Egypt from off you. i.e. This day I have freed you from that shame & dishonour which did lye upon you whilst ye were bondslaves in the Land of Egypt, by receiving you into covenant & communion with my self, & acknowledging yt for my peculiar people, & admitting you to have this priviledge, sealed unto you by this seal of circumcision. Or by this Reproach of Egypt may be meant ye Reproach w'ch did lye upon the Egyptians themselves, as upon all other Nations in ye being out of Coven't w'th God, & not partakers of the Seals thereof, they were Aliens, and strangers to God, in an Heathenish & damnable condition, & were so reputed, & had in abomination w'h the Church & people of God. For yt was one end for which God appointed the Sacramt of Circumcision viz, to distinguish between his own peculiar servants, & other people, as may be gathered from ye, 12. Exod. 48. And hince it is ye profane Nations are characterized by their being uncircumcised & so out of Coven't with God. 34. Gen. 14. 1. Sam. 14. 6. & many other places. So Sais God here: You were before Uncircumcised as ye Egyptians & other Aliene Nations. You were out of Covenant as they. There was no difference between you & my cursed enemies. This was your Reproach: your disgrace but now it is rolled away. * Vide pag. 7 last words.\n\nProp: It is an Egyptian-like disgrace & Reproach to be out of visible & Sacramentall communion with God in his Ordinances.)\n\n2. An: From mans account, that is to say the account of ye best of men, godly men in all ages have\n\npage: 9\nlookt upon it, as indeed it is, a disgrace & Reproach to be void of visible & Sacramentall communion with God, & therefore have deeply bewayled such a condition. 42. Ps. 1-5. 74. Ps. 1-11. 79. Ps. 80. Ps. 1-12. But I must not stay here.\n\n3. An: Last in a word. From ye nature of ye thing: Because it is in such a way as God dos offer his seal up to us, & also confirm our Faith in an interest in whatsoever dos or can indeed exalt us. 17. Gen. 11. Ye shall circumcise ye flesh of your Foreskin, & it shall be a token of the Covenant be twixt you & me. And this Circumcision sais Paul. 4. Rom. 11. was a seal of the righteousness of Faith. It was signu [sign] memorativu [memorative]:, introductivum [introductive], demonstrativum [demonstrative], prefigurativum [prefigurative], distinctivum [distinctive]. But I must but hint at such things. So of ye Lords Supper, sais Christ. 26. Matt. 28. This is my blood of the New-Testament. i.e. a sign & Seal thereof.\n\n2. Prop: When God doth graciously bring such a people to ye enjoym't of his Ordinances, then, & thereby God doth not only take away their former Egyptian-like disgrace & Reproach but also most highly exalt dignify & promote them. Before they were Profane as other Nations: now they are holy foederally holy. Before they were grosly ignorant of their best good, last End, & way to it, now they have the knowledge hereof: & these things exalt a people above all others 147 Ps. 19. 20. 3. Rom. 1. 2. Other Nations are said to have been without God, because the public wrongly without Gods lively Oracles & exalting Ordinances. 2.\n\npage: 10\nChr. 15. 3. where its said even of Gods Israel that they were without God, because without the publick worship & ordinances of God. But on the other hand where God bestows his ordinances the signs of his gracious favour & presence such a people are said to be exalted, yea to be highly exalted, to be exalted unto Heaven as Christ sais of Capernaum. II. Matt. 23.\n\nReas: in one word because of the blessed presence of Christ in his Ordinances when duly attended upon. As\n\n1.Christ is present there in his Royall & Kingly Majesty. 4. Rev. 1. 2. By which heaven is by some, & very well may be, meant, not only the third heaven, but also his instituted Churches wherein as in heaven, Christ as a King sits & dwells, holding out the Sceptre, the golden Sceptre of grace, and offers most Royall & inestimable bounties.\n\n2. Christ is present there in his Mediatoriall Beauty. 27. Ps. 4.-- To behold ye beauty of the Lord. i.e. to enjoy the blessed worship & ordinances of God's house, wherein Christ Jesus is offered unto, & accepted of, ye beleiver, as his greatest beauty & delight.\n\n3. Last: Christ is present there in wayes of Communication & bounty according to ye promise. 20. Ex. 24. Here it is ye Hammer of Gods word by the hand of his spirit breaks ye Rocks in peices. Here it is ye eyes of ye blind are opened, & the ears of ye deaf are unstopped. Here it is that ye strong man armed (the Devil) meets with one that is stronger than he (who overmatcheth him, viz Christ Jesus) Who turns him out of his tenement, the Souls of sinners & works deliverance for the lawfull Captive. Here it is that ye poor are filled, yea feasted: the\n\npage: 11\nwounded are anointed: the sorrowfull are comforted: the shagless are reduced: & the weak confirmed &\n\nI aim at a word or two of use & so shall shut up which great brevity because of the shortness & somwhat sharpness of the season; & the considerableness of time that the remaining work calls for.\n\n1. Use Information\n\n1. Hince learn we to adore, & in our very souls to magnify, the free grace of God in our Lord Jesus, for the gracious distinction he is pleased to make between us in New-England and millions of others. We are all one by nature with Egyptians, Turks, Pagans, Indians, Ethiopians, & but we differ vastly in holy Priveledges. If we ask ourselves, as Paul dos ye Corinthians 1. Ep. Cor. 4. 7. who make[s] ye difference? There is a vast difference indeed. But how comes it? Why not from any merit in us, but from the mercy of God to us as to Israel of old. 7. Deut. 6. 7. 8. It is God who hath rolled away our disgrace & Reproach, & brought this honour & dignity upon us: & seing it is the Lords gracious doing let it be marvellous in our eyes. Sais David, when Zadock brought after him (in his flight from Absalom) the Ark of ye Covenant of God, carry it back: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the Lord he will bring me again & shew me both it & his habitation. 2. Sam. 15. 24. 25. So I say we have found favour in Gods eyes, let us thankfully own it, & admire at it: & say not unto us, not unto us, or our merits, but unto Gods Name is due the glory of these distinguishing privelledges\n\npage: 12\n2. Hince learn Ye at this place (this Village) that God hath graciously brought you to a good day this day. This is the day wherein God is giving you hopes that he will roll away the Reproach of Egypt from off you. It is true indeed some of you (& yet alas but a few of you) were partakers of visible & Sacramentall communion which God in his Ordinances, by virtue of your Memberships with other Churches of our Lord Jesus. I but still you had no such settled sacred & Royall dignities, & distinguishing privelledges among your selves. The Reproach of Egypt continued in the place, tho some few persons were exempted from it. Now w' an Egyptian-like disgrace & Reproach was it for such a Number of people (so well able to maintain the Lords Ordinances) in such a land as New-England, so long to continue unlike their professing Neighbours, without the signs & seals of the blessed Covenant of Grace? In the eyes of God, & in the eyes of godly persons this was your Reproach. But this day God gives you hopes of rolling away this Reproach from off you.\n\n3. Last: (To say no more) This doctrine serves to vindicate & justify the holy & Spirituall disquietness of such who were groaning in spirit under the want of the seals of the Covenant to be brought home to their own doors. If there are any grieved at ye restlessness of such in that condition, let them but remember ye Reproach such were under, & that is enough to vindicate their labour after the rolling of it away. Therefore\n\n2. Use may be of caution & admonition. Let none be offended at the work of this day. Do not Reproach the goodness of God: when he is about rolling away of your Reproach: let none say\n\npage: 13\nin their hearts, they were in as good a case before, they see not that they were under any Reproach; or the like. I may say to such as Moses did to Korah. 16. Num. 9. Seemeth it a small thing to you that ye God of Israel hath brought you near to himself &c\n\n1. Consider by so thinking, or speaking, you contradict God himself. He calls it a rolling away of your Reproach &c\n\n2. Consider by so thinking, or speaking, you will be found in Gods eyes (whatever you are in mens) guilty of a profane Esau-like spirit.\n\n3. Use. Last: Exhortation\n\n1. To all who belong to this small Congregation. Oh be exhorted to meet God in the gracious work that he is this day about of rolling away your Reproach from off you, by getting into ye covenant of grace, & so coming under the Seals of ye covenant.\n\nAnd to that end attend heedfully & constantly to the Preaching of the word, by which ye spirit ofGod is wont first to move ye soul to entertain Christ, before it sets his Seal upon the Soul of its interest in Christ in ye Sacrament And remember whilst you keep off from the Seals of the covenant you are maintainers of your own Reproach. The very Seals of ye covenant whereby we are initiated into, & confirmed in an interest in Christ is as holy Calvin sais worth an hundered lives. And remember it is not the bare privation, but the contempt of Sacraments (as Bernard sais truly) is damnable & destructive. Therefore you cannot hereafter live without partaking of the ordinances, but you\n\npage: 14\nwill of necessity heighten your sins by such neglects or omissions. But I must not insist\n\n2. To all of us who are more especially concerned in the work of this good day: from of whom God is rolling away our Reproach, & upon whom God is about conferring honour & dignity: Oh let us be exhorted in our places most heedfully to Beware of Reproaching & disgracing the work of this day, & for prevention thereof there is no better way in all ye world than to take direction from the word of God how we are each of us from this day forward to behave our selves. In a word\n\n1. I will begin with my self. Much work is laid, or like to be laid, upon my weak shoulders. I will labour to sum it up in a word\n\nI am to carry it not as a Lord, but as a Servant, yet not as mans but the Lords servant: now the greater the Master, the greater the service.\n\nI am to be zealous in my Masters service: to give my self wholly to these things. I am in all godliness to labour to be exemplary. I am to labour that my doctrine may burn, & my con- versation may shine\n\nI am to make difference between ye clean, & unclean: so as to labour to cleanse & purge the one, & confirm & strengthen the other.\n\nAs I am to give Cordials to some, so I must be sure to administer corrosives to others. And what I do this way without partial respect to persons, you must not, you cannot, you ought not to be angry, for so I am commanded.\n\nHere is some, & but some of my work, & yet here is work enough, & work hard enough: yet this must be attended, or I shall Reproach the work of this day: & therefore for my help herein I crave, & humbly challenge an interest in all\n\npage: 15\nyour fervent Prayers who would not have your God Reproached.\n\n2. I will begin now come to you my Brethren, & usual hearers: somthing you are to do, & not a little neither. You are to pay me that Reverence which is due to an Embassadour of Christ Jesus. You are to bear me a great deal of love. 1. Thes. 5. 13. You are indeed highly to love every Minister of Christ Jesus: but (if you can notwithstanding the vast disproportion between my self & others) you are to love me best. You are to obey me (at lest) so far as I watch for your souls. 13. Hebr. I7. You are to communicate to me of your carnall good things, both that which is stable, sufficient & (according to your capacity) honourable: & that not as a piece of alms, or charity, but of justice & duty. 15· Rom. 27. 1. Cor. 9. 11. 6. Gal. 6. 1. Tim. 5. 17. 18.\n\nYou are to pray for me, & to pray much & fervently alwayes for me, but especially when you expect to hear from God by me.\n\nYou are to endeavour by all lawfull means to make my heavy work as much as in you lyes light & cheerfull. 13. Hebr. 17. And not by unchristian like behaviour to my selfe, or one another, or other Churches of God, or any whither within or without, or to God, or man to add to my burthen, & to make my life among you grievous, & my labour among you unprofitable. So yt you see here is work enough for you also: & therefore by your leave, & in your Name, what I just now requested for my self, I will also desire for you of all praying persons that they would pray for a Sufficiency of page: 16grace yt both you & I may give up a good account in the Season thereof: And as every lover of Gods honour will, so let them, say\n\nAmen.",

      "\nHome\nArchives\nBooks & Diaries\nDocuments\nMaps\nPeople\nA Further Account of the Tryals of the New-England Witches, sent in a Letter from thence, to a Gentleman in London.\nLetter to Nathaniel Higginson\n\nThis �letter� appended to an edition of Deodat Lawson�s A Brief and True Narrative, in a reprinted form dated 1692�listed in London Massachusetts Historical card catalog as 1693.\n\nA Further Account of the Tryals of the New-England Witches, sent in a Letter from thence, to a Gentleman in London.\nHere were in Salem, June 10, 1692, about 40 persons that were afflicted with horrible torments by Evil Spirits, and the afflicted have accused 60 or 70 as Witches, for that they have Spectral appearances of them, tho the Persons are absent when they are tormented. When these Witches were Tried, several of them confessed a contract with the Devil, by signing his Book, and did express much sorrow for the same, delareing also thir Confederate Witches, and said the Tempters of them desired �em to sign the Devils Book, who tormented them till they did it. There were at the time of Examination, before many hundreds of Witnesses, strange Pranks play�d; such as the taking Pins out of the Clothes of the afflicted, and thrusting them into their flesh; many of which were taken out again by the Judges own hands. Thorns also in like kind were thrust into their flesh; the accusers were sometimes struck dumb, deaf, blind, and sometimes lay as if they were dead for a while, and all foreseen and declared by the afflicted just before �twas done. Of the afflicted there were two Girls, about 12 or 13 years of age, who saw all that was done, and were therefore called the Visionary Girls; they would say, Now he, or she, or they, are going to bite, or pinch the Indian; and all there present in Court saw the visible marks on the Indians arms; they would also cry out, Now look, look, they are going to bind such an ones Legs, and all present saw the same person spoken of, fall with her Legs twisted in an extraordinary manner; Now say they, we shall all fall, and immediately 7 or 8 of the afflicted fell down, with terrible shrieks and Out-crys; at the time when one of the Witches was sentenc�d, and pinnion�d with a Cord, at the same time was the afflicted Indian Servant going home, being about 2 or 3 miles out of town, and had both his Wrists at the same instant bound about with a like Cord, in the same manner as she was when she was sentenc�d, but with that violence, that the Cord entered into his flesh, not to be untied, not hardly cut�. Many Murders are suppos�d to be in this way committed; for these Girls, and others of the afflicted, say, they see Coffins, and bodies in Shrowds, rising up, and looking on the accused, crying, Vengeance, Vengeance on the Murderers-- Many other strange things were transacted before the Court in the time of their Examination; and especially one thing which I had like to have forgot, which is this, One of the accus�d, whilst the rest were under Examination, was drawn up by a Rope to the Roof of the house where he was, and would have been choak�d in all probability, had not the Rope been presently cut; the rope hung at the Roof by some invisible tye, for there was no hole where it went up; but after it was cut the remainder of it was found in the Chamber just above, lying by the very place where it hung down.\n\nIn December 1692, the Court sate again at Salem in New-England, and cleared about 40 persons suspected for Witches, and Condemned three. The Evidence against these three was the same as formerly, so the Warrant for their Execution was sent, and the Graves digged for the said three, and for about five more that had been Condemned at Salem formerly, but were Repreived by the Governour.\n\nIn the beginning of February 1693, the Court sate at Charles-Town, where the Judge exprest himself to this effect.\n\nThat who it was that obstructed the Execution of Justice, or hindered those good proceedings they had made, he knew not, but thereby the Kingdom of Satan was advanc�d, &c and the Lord have mercy on this Country; and so declined coming any more into Court. In his absence Mr. D--- sate as Chief Judge 3 several days, in which time 5 or 6 were clear�d by Proclamation, and almost as many by Trial; so that all are acquitted.\n\nThe most remarkable was an Old Woman named Dayton, of whom it was said, If any in the World were a Witch, she was one, and had been so accounted 30 years. I had the Curiosity to see her tried; she was a decrepid Woman of about 80 years of age, and did not use many words in her own defence. She was accused by about 30 Witnesses; but the matter alledged against her was such as needed little apology, on her part not one passionate word, or immoral action, or evil, was then objected against her for 20 years past, only strange accidents falling out, after some Christian admonition given by her, as saying, God would not prosper them, if they wrong�d the Widow. Upon the whole, there was not prov�d against her any thing worthy of Reproof, or just admonition, must less so heinous a Charge.\n\nSo that by the Goodness of God we are once more out of present danger of this Hobgoblin Monster; the standing Evidence used at Salem were called, but did not appear.\n\nThere were others also at Charles-town brought upon their Tryals, who had formerly confess�d themselves to be Witches; but upon their tryals deny�d it, and were all clear�d; So that at present there is no further prosecution of any.

Feb. 1691\nConco.5.}\n\n110. Ps. 1 The Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.\n\nDoctr. Our once humbled wounded & bruised Mediator has long since been exalted not only by a Glorious Resurrection from the Grave, & also by Glorious Ascension into heaven, but also by a Glorious Session at the right handof God.\n\nWe have shown you what this Session is: & when it did begin: And (3) Last: are speaking to the fruits of it. Why (1) The benefit hereof partly appertains to Christs Sacerdotal Office, viz: his Intercession for believers (2) It belongs partly to his Kingly Office: & consists (1) In his governing of his Church\n\n1. Use. Information in a few particulars\n\n1. Infer: This Doctrine of Christs sitting at the right hand of God the Father may eminently confirm that sound & wholsome doctrine of Divine Providence. It is a woful peice of our corruption in an evil time, when the wicked prosper, & the godly party meet with vexations by & by to cry down divine Providence, as if God had forsaken the earth, & there were no profit in his service, as they 3. Mat. 14. 15. It is in vain to serve God --- And now we\n\npage: 140\ncall the proud happy: yea they that work wickedness are set up -- Yea & this is an an error that in times of the Churches adversity the godly themselves are apt to slide into. 73 Ps. 2. &c. But when they look into the word of God & hear what God sais in his Sanctuary they will be better instructed. 16. v. &c. There is a King that governs all: Christ Jesus who is King of Kings, by whom Kings reign, & princes decree justice. And he is called Gods King. 2. Ps. 6. because God hath annointed him King of his Church & Governor of the Nations. 2. Ps. 6. 8. 9. &c He has a providential Kingdom & a spiritual Kingdom.\n\n2. Infer: This doctrine of Christs sitting at the right hand of God may confirm the Doctrine of the Divine nature of Christ. As his Conception, Birth, Life, & Death, hold forth the truth of his Humann nature: so his Ressurection from the Grave, & sitting at the right hand of God hold forth the truth of his Divine nature. This is an Honour (as the Apostle argues) too big for the holy Angels. 1. Heb. 13. And agreable only to him that is equal to God.\n\n3. Infer: This doctrine of Christs sitting at the right hand of God may confirm that Christ hath a church. It holds forth Christs Kingly power (as has been known) therefore this King hath some Subjects. For King and Subjects: as Father & Son, & the like are Relates, & most strongly argue one another. No subjects, no King &c. Hince Christ calls the Church my People: & he tells us that no enemies shall overthrow his Church. 16. Matth. 18.\n\n4. Infer: Last: This doctrine may cofirm the truth of the Perseverance of the Saints: because stronger is he that is with us & for us, then he that is against us. There are three arguments for the truth of this point.\n\n1. The blessed purpose of God. 2. Tim. 1. 9. Who hath saved us, & called us according to his own purpose & Grace, which was given to us in Christ before the world began. Now the counsels & purpose of God cannot faile.\n\n2. The free Promise of God for their perserverance. 32. Jer. 39. 40. -- I will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me. 10. Zech. ult. I will strengthen them in the Lord, & they shall walk up & down in his Name, saith the Lord.\n\npage: 341\n3. Last: From the undertaking of Christ for them.\n\n1. As their High-Priest, he Intercedes for them. 22. Luke. 32. I have prayed for thee that they faith fail not. 17 Joh. 9. 11. 20. I pray for them -- Holy Father, keep thro thine own Name, those that thou hast given me &c.\n\n2. As their great Prophet he teacheth, & instructeth them by his holy Spirit unto eternal life. 1. Joh. 2. 20. Ye have an Unction from the holy one, & ye know all things. i.e. all things necessary to Salvation. Christ as a Prophet reveals the whole & perfect & Saving will of God. Hince he is called & saving will of God. Hince he is called not only a Prophet, but a teacher, the Apostle of our profession, the Angel of the Covenant, The Wisdom of God, the treasure of Wisdom & Knowledge.\n\n3. Last: As their King he undertakes the Government of them: The Subduing all their lusts; the strengthning all their Graces, so that they should not fall totally and finally. 10. Joh. 27. 28. My sheep follow me: & I give unto them eternal life. & they shall never perish, neither any pluck them out of my hand. Sin would pluck them, & Satan would pluck them out of my hand, but they shall never be able to do it.\n\n2. Use. Instruction, & Exhortation.\n\n1. O be we all exhorted to get an interest in Christ Jesus. For this end the Gosple is sent calling you under Christs Kingdom. And for our slighting of Christ Jesus God is angry & sending forth destroyers\n\n1. Mot Oh would you have an Intercessor, an Advocate with the Father; Oh then embrace Christ Jesus upon Gospel termes 1. Joh. 2. 1. What has Jews done in Hamans dayes had it not been for an Intercessor Queen Esther. Why loe Satan can produce a worser bond signed & sealed by the hand of Gods justice, by wch we are under a double death, namely bodily & Spiritual. But loe here is an Intercessor, not a queen Esther, but a Christ, an all powerful Mediator: Oh then away to Christ &c.\n\npage: 142\nAt the right hand of God\n2. Mot: Oh would you have your enemies, your lusts, the Devil trod under your feet? 2. Tim. 4. 18. The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work. 1. Cor. 15. 57.Oh then embrace Christ Jesus\n\n2. Instr: As often as we appear before God & offer him our prayers, or praises do well all in the Name of Christ. For it is He alone who sits at the Right hand of God the Father that perfumes our offerings, & whereby they become a sweet smelling savour unto God: And the Father in & by his Son will make returns to us of all needed blessings. Let us not therefore imitate the blind world who give God their services without any consideration had to the Mediator. Christ gives us other instruments. 14 Joh. 13. 14. -- whatsoever ye shall ask in my Name, that I will do -- And thus Believers are wont to pray. 9 Dan. 17. Now this imports three things.\n\n1. A deep sense of unworthiness both of our Persons & our service of divine acceptance\n\nOf our Persons since the fall. 18. Gen. 27. I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord which are but dust and ashes. So the Publicane. 18. Luke. 13. who stood far off, would not life up so much as his eyes to Heaven, but smote upon his breat, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. So the Centurion. 7. Luke bwfinning Lord I am not worthythat thou shouldst come to me, no nor worthy that I should come unto thee\n\n2. Of our prayers & services. For the Person being unworthy needs most his services be so: for we can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? As we see in the Church. 64 Isa.6. We are all as an unclean thing, & all our Righteousness are as filthy rags. 3. Philip. 9.\n\nA Deep sense of our Need of an Intercessor: a Mediator between God & man\n\n2. Last: An apprehension of the Sufficiency of Christs Worthiness. 1. Eph. 6. Accepted in the beloved. This is required in our offerings to God.\n\npage: 143\nOf Christs Glorious Session\nConco. 6.} ac ultima }\n\n14. Feb. 1691\n110.Ps. 1\nThe Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, untill I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Doctr.) our once humbled wounded & bruised Mediatour, has long since been exalted not only by a Glorious Resurrection from the Grave, & also by a Glorious Ascension into Heaven, but also by a Glorious Session at the right hand og God. (1. U.) Informaation (2. U.) Instruction (1) To get an interest in Christ (2) To offer all our Services to God in the Name of Christ. To proceed.\n\n3. Instruction. To be very thankful for, & to make utmost improvement of, the Ministry of the of the word, & the divine Ordinances we are priviledged by. It is by the Ministry of the word, through the efficacy of the Spirit, that Christ brings us into his blessed Kingdom. This is the very end of Christ in sending forth his Ambassadours. 26. Acts. 15-19. And it is by his Ordinances of Baptisme & the Lords Supper that he Seals us up to the day of Redemption. 4. Eph. 30. It is at his Table (where some of us have been this day, & more should come) that Christ gives forth his Loves. 7.Cant. 12.\n\n4. Instr: It teacheth Ministers to endeavour a true separation between the precious & the vile, & to labour what in them lyes to gather a pure Church unto Christ, a Church of holy subjects, for this is a principal end of Christ in giving his word. 15. Jer. 19. those that will subject to the Laws of this great King we are to accept, & to encourage & comfort: others we are to refuse & reject.\n\n5. Instr: It teacheth Hearers if they would have the benefit of the word & Ordinances, that they look unto Christ: for the Saving efficacy hereof is from him. 1. Cor. 3. 5. &c. We must say in this case, as Peter & John did concerning, the people that they as Instruments healed. 3. Acts. 6. &c\n\n6. Instr: It teacheth us to War a good warfare, to subdue all our Spiritual enemies, if we would reign with\n\npage: 144\nAt the Right hand of God\nChrist in his Kingdom. 3. Rev. 21. To him yt overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne, even as I also overcame, & am set down with my Father in his Throne.\n\n7. Instr: It may teach us that we be not ashamed to own & confess Christ Jesus who is so gloriously exhalted: nor to be offended at the present low condition of the Church in the midst of its enemies. Oh shortly the case will be far otherwise. And therefore let us look more at future things, & follow the cloud of witnesses, & our Lord Jesus himself. 12. Heb. 1. 2. 3.\n\n8. Instr: It techeth us not only to look unto Christ as a Priest to intercede for us, but as mighty King to give us victory as we need. We are to make use of him as a Priest. 4. Heb. 14.15.16. And also as a Mighty King, we can make us more than conqueror. 8. Ro. 36. 37.\n\n9. Instr: Last: Because Christ is so great a King hince three things especailly are required of us.\n\n1. That we give him great Reverence & Honour. This is required that at the Name of Jesus every kneeshould bow &c. 2. Philip. 8. 9. 10. 11. It is taken ut of 45. Isa. 22. 23. 24. 25. Good men will not speak of good earthly Princes without due respect & Honour. How much more Honour is due to this King of Kings. Davids heart smote him when he cut off Sauls garment because he was the Lords anointed: how much more should our hearts quake, & our bowels Tremble upon the Discovery of dishonour cast upon either by ourselves, or others.\n\n2. That we give him due obedience: For if obedience be due to an Earthly Prince, or Superior tho but in the family: Oh but what then is due from us to Christ, whose Subjects & houshold servants we all are? Let us then imitate those good subjects, who when Saul was chosen King, brought him presents as tokens of subjugation, & not Sons of Belial wo despised him. 1. Sam. 10. 26. 27.\n\n3. Last: That we be grateful & Thankful unto Christ for\n\npage: 145\nOf Christs Glorious Session\nthe great & singular & and provident care he takes of us. Oh we might have been left out into the wild wilderness to inhabit the Regions of the shadow of Death &c.\n\nWe were by nature far off, but this blessed King has brough us near to himself. Oh the gratitude that is due him from us which should be expressed\n\nBy a ready & Cheerful attendance upon him in his Courts. 100. Ps. totu. Oh what a wonderful favour is this, that the great King should still be holding forth the Golden Scepter of his Grace to us every Sab: day! Oh the joyful sound that we hear &c.\n\n2. By a cheer obsedience to all his known & revealed will. Oh this is a good King; all his laws are good; & therefore how ready should we be in obsedience? We should imitate the great joy that was at Solomons coronation. 1. Reg. 1. 39. 40.\n\nLast: By not counting our very lives to dear for Christ, our King. This great King, has laid down his life for his Subjects; Ho much more ought we to lay down our lives for him, & imitate those three Heroes that for King David jeopardized their lives. 2. Sam. 23.15. 16. 17.\n\n3.Use. Caution to us all: O Have we a care we persist not in our natural Rebellion to this great King 2. Ps. 6 &c\n\n4.Last: Consolation in several particulars\n\n1. This Doctr: of Christs session at the right hand of God, as Priest inderceding for us confirms us In the Blessed doctrinr og Gods free grace in remission of sin by Jesus Christ. 1. Job. 2. 1. 2. If If any man sin we have an advocate with the Father. Oh this confortable news. It is hereby we may look up to God with holy confidence; & that God looks down upon us with delight. Oh then get an interest in Christ 5. Eph. 27. And all our Spots shall be done away\n\n2. This may comfort all Belivers in the assuranceof their perserverance: because this great King will not suffer any of his sheep to be pluckt out of his hands. It is true the Righteous fall, they fall afer conversion, as well as before conversion, & sin carries along with it the demerit of Death, & that not only temporal, but eternal, but having a perfect high Priest he makes full attonement 3. Phil. 9\n\npage: 146\nat the right hand of God\n3. This gives comfort that our works & service become acceptable with God the Father upon account of Christs intercession. Our works in themselves cannot please God, because they are in part good, & in part poluted: for a truly Regenerate person is part carnal & in part spiritual; & therefore the work cannot be perfect. But now by the Intercession of Christ his Merit & Satisfaction is imputed to us as if it were our own. This is the Golden Censer that perfumes all the services of Beleivers. 8 Rev. 3.\n\n4. This may comfort us in that Christs intercession is of ye efficacy that it procures the communion of the Holy Spirit, that helpeth our infermities. 8. Ro. 26.\n\nAlthlough therefore the Intercession of Christ be made in the Heavens, yet the fruits of it are enjoyed on the Earth even as the body of the Sun placed in the Heavens, yet it influenceth us & the earth with its warming beams. Therefore if we would know whiter Christ intercedes for us, there is no need to ascend up into the Heaven, but to descend into our own hearts, & examine whith'r we have the benefit of it. We need not climb up into the clouds to see wither the Sun shine or no: so here &c\n\n5. Last: This may comfort us in that we have a King to our Saviour: Therefore we should look to him for all help: And because he Governs his church, not only by his word & spirit, but also by his Rod, & afflictions: therefore we are to beware of fainting when we are chastened, or despising the Rod. 12. Heb. 5. Also we are to look to him for the good of all, he chastens us for our profit. 12. Heb. 10. Also we are to rest in the Government of Christ. The Church may meet with storms, but it shall never sink. For Christ sits not idle in the Heavens, but takes most faithful case of his little Ship (the Church) bound for the port of Heaven, laden with many precious gems & Jewels, a treasure purchased by his own inestimable blood. He hath Seven eyes, & Seven horns. 5. Rev. 6. perfection of wisdom & perfection of Power, & all engaged for believers, and therefore you have no cause to fear &c\n\nSo much for Christs Glorious Exaltation\n\nFinis Textus.",

      "SalemNews.com, Salem, MA\nNovember 5, 2010\nTaking a fresh look at the Salem Witch Trials\nBy Will Broaddus\nStaff Writer\n\nSALEM — Generations of scholars have studied the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, but they're still uncovering new insights.\n\nBenjamin Ray, a professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia, will discuss important new evidence, discovered by applying historic forensics to legal documents from the trials, in a talk this Sunday at The House of the Seven Gables. His talk, \"A New Look at the Salem Witch Trials: Report on the Most Recent Research,\" will address \"Records of the Salem Witch-Hunt,\" a 1,010-page book Ray edited that was published in 2009.\n\nRay is descended from Salem villagers who signed a petition in defense of Rebecca Nurse, who was eventually hanged as a witch, and he is also co-project leader with Bernard Rosenthal of the online Salem Witch Trials Documentary Archive and Transcription Project.\n\nThe talk is at 2 p.m. Admission is $10, $5 for The House of the Seven Gables members. Call 978-744-0991, ext. 104, for tickets. For more information, visit www.7gables.org.\n\nWhat is your talk about?\n\nIt's on the most recent research on the trials. It's not just my research; it's associated with the publication of a new edition of the Salem Witch Trials court records.\n\nHow many court records are there?\n\nThere are nearly a thousand individual documents that survive in archives in Salem and Boston. It's a new edition, a scholarly transcription of the original manuscript, with notes. The key thing is, it's a chronological organization of these documents for the first time.\n\nHow were they originally arranged?\n\nAccording to cases. They were dockets, organized by the name of the person accused, so when these were transcribed and published, they were alphabetical. We can now see more clearly how things happened. That's key: the legal process from beginning to end is now more fully understood. The what and the how and the when — those key historical questions — it is now much more productive to work on them.\n\nWhat does the chronology tell you?\n\nYou see the decisions made by magistrates, villagers and church members who set up the framework, which made the initial legal procedure such that it could go out of control. We can see who's playing very large roles, who's a principal figure, people we've known about but are seeing in a new light. Samuel Parris, the minister of the village, and Thomas Putnam. They were instrumental in forwarding the legal process.\n\nWhat went wrong with that process?\n\nIt looked like a normal situation. Hey, what's two or three people accused of witchcraft? Nothing unusual about that. But they relied on spectral evidence (testimony about supernatural visitations from demons), used it in such a way it could not be stopped. The reason why they did that, in my view, had to do with an unprecedented attack on the very institution of the church. Not just neighbor against neighbor, but an assault on the central Puritan institution.\n\nIf the documents were unsigned, how were you able to determine who wrote them?\n\nThe transcriptions team has identified the handwriting. It's like looking at a set of cold-case files. The handwriting analysis was discovered by transcribers as they were working with depositions — hundreds of depositions — and identifying the handwriting because they are seeing the same handwriting in many documents.\n\nWhat do the documents tell us about Putnam?\n\nThomas Putnam is the person writing the most depositions, over 120 that we know of, on behalf of the core group accusing witches in the village. So now we can look at: Who is he writing on behalf of? What are his social connections, his position in the church, to most of the accusers in the village and the people writing what are called \"the complaints\"? These are mostly members of the church in the village, and they feel they're under threat.\n\nWill this book allow people to do their own forensic investigations?\n\nAt $150, it's very expensive. But it's putting in the hands of everyone what scholars have achieved in a 10-year project. It's introduced by essays on how language is used at the time, what the legal process is, then some general introduction to how the chronology is raised. Only about a third of the documents are dated at the time when they were used in court, so it's necessary to use contextual evidence, and that is discussed. I'll bring a copy of the book to my talk and show people how it's organized.",

      '\n\nA University That Reveres Tradition Experiments With E-Books\nBy JEFFREY R. YOUNG\nCharlottesville, Va\nArticle originally published in Chronicle of Higher Education. May 11, 2001.\n  Textbook pages never rustle during a University of Virginia seminar about the Salem witch trials, because printed books have been replaced by electronic ones. Students in the experimental course were lent hand-held computers loaded with several assigned textbooks, as well as electronic versions of every warrant, indictment, and deposition from the trials.\n\nThe course was designed to take advantage of two of the most celebrated features of digital textbooks -- their capacity to hold reams of data and their ability to let readers easily search for any word or phrase. In the classroom, students became on-the-spot historians, using the gadgets to home in on court documents so they could argue for and against various interpretations of what happened in Salem, Mass., more than 300 years ago.\n\nMany futurists have predicted the death of the book, but the printed word has proven extremely difficult to replicate electronically in a form that is as elegant and easy to read as text on paper. A pilot project here this spring, comprising two courses, attempted to see whether the latest e-book technologies could allow entire courses to go bookless.\n\nDuring class sessions, students tapping on tiny screens with plastic styluses looked more as if they were taking scientific readings than discussing history and religion. The setting was decidedly old-fashioned, though; the class met in one of the few classrooms remaining from Jefferson\'s "academical village."\n\n"Whenever we got to talking about something in a document, we would just go to the document," says Amy Nichols, a senior who took the course. The students say they used court records and other texts more than they would have with bulky printed versions of the same documents.\n\nWhat\'s more, the students were bolder than usual in criticizing scholarly summaries of events presented in their textbooks, says Benjamin C. Ray, the religious-studies professor teaching the course. In fact, they were often too quick to dispute scholarly accounts once they came upon source material that seemed to contradict the textbook, he says. "I think they\'re going overboard. They\'re trashing too much ... without knowing the historical methods."\n\nLosing Data\nFor their part, the students quickly discovered disadvantages of the high-tech texts. Unlike paper books, e-books sometimes crash. Several students lost marginal notes and bookmarks when their hand-held computers suddenly erased their data.\n\nSome students said reading from the tiny screens made the texts seem more fragmented. "When I\'m at home sitting on my chair curled up with the afghan on my lap, I don\'t want to be flipping through this," says Kristen Buckstad, a student in the course, holding up her Hewlett-Packard Journada, which sells for about $450. The hand-held device is roughly the size of a Palm Pilot, with a 2-1/2-by-3-1/4-inch color screen and enough memory to store about 90 books. "The screen is too small," she says. "It\'s hard to get the overall feeling of the flow of the narrative."\n\nStudents can also read their assignments on laptops or desktop computers. The electronic texts are available on the World Wide Web through Virginia\'s Electronic Text Center, which since 1992 has worked with the university\'s libraries to create digital copies of scholarly and literary books.\n\nTitles in that archive include classic texts that are no longer covered by copyright, as well as texts for which the university has bought the distribution rights. Its virtual shelves feature a mix of the often-studied and the obscure, in languages that include Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Latin, and Apache.\n\nThe e-text center selected two courses for its pilot project: the one on the Salem witch trials, which is a senior-level undergraduate course, and a graduate-level English course about depictions of space in 18th- and 19th-century literature.\n\nThe e-books for both courses were formatted with new Microsoft text-display software called Reader. Microsoft provided most of the loaner hand-held computers -- and did its best to turn the two courses into product focus groups. A representative from Microsoft sat in on one session of each course and later interviewed many of the students. Those who agreed to be interviewed got copies of Microsoft Office 2000 for their trouble, though many felt that the company was being stingy in not letting them keep the Journadas as well.\n\nThe promise of the Reader software is to provide an interface that faithfully simulates the pages of a book, in typefaces that are clearer and easier to read than typical computer fonts. The e-text center has converted 1,600 e-books in its online library to the Microsoft format since last summer. It also has created versions of the same books using text-display software developed by Palm for use on its hand-held computers. Standard hypertext versions of the texts remain available as well.\n\nDavid Seaman, director of the center, says the new formats are far better to curl up with for extended reading than traditional Web formats. "Nobody reads books on the Web. You think of the Web as a searching-and-browsing technology. It\'s not a reading technology."\n\nArticle Continued\n\n',

      '\nWednesday January 6th, 1999.\n©www.salemnews.com, 1999\nWitch Web site provides historic truth\nBy Peter DeMarco\nOriginally published in the Salem Evening News\nJanuary 6, 1999\nDANVERS -- Those accused of witchcraft in Old Salem Village 300 years ago were put to death by hanging. But try and find that vital fact on the Internet, and you might be out of luck.\n\n"You see things like ... they were burned at the stake," said Richard Trask, town archivist. "There\'s so much bogus stuff out there, it\'s amazing."\n\nThere is at least one Web site with accurate information about the witchcraft hysteria, though.\n\nIt\'s the new Danvers Archives home page, which can be reached at http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft.\n\nThe site, which has been up and running only a few weeks, contains court documents from the Rebecca Nurse trial.\n\nThere\'s information about historical sites in Danvers, the witchcraft memorial, and an excerpt from Trask\'s book "The Devil Hath Been Raised."\n\nSo far about 70 pages of historic material have been entered into the system, Trask says, with more to be added this year.\n\nThe site is the brainchild of Ben Ray, a professor of religion studies at the University of Virginia.\n\nAs the story goes, Ray came to Danvers about five years ago hoping to find out about his ancestors, a prominent Danvers family.\n\nThrough Trask and Anthony Patton, a Locust Street resident who lives in a Colonial home once owned by Ray\'s family, the professor learned that four of his ancestors signed petitions supporting Nurse.\n\nBut when Ray turned to the Internet for more information about the witchcraft trials, he found little of substance.\n\n"A lot of it was sensationalist or New Age," he said. "There was (information) that the Salem witches were of an ancient pagan religion, which is a terrible distortion."\n\n"What I objected to the most was the celebration (on some sites) of the whole thing," he said. "I began thinking about what I might do in a small way to correct that."\n\nSo Ray, through the university, teamed with Trask, the authority on the witchcraft trials, to establish the first Danvers Archives Web site. He also had it listed on major search engines.\n\n\n\n\t\nThe Danvers Archives home page shows accurate information about the Salem Witchcraft trials.\n\n\nAnd that\'s just the beginning. Ray has received $15,000 in grant money to establish a University of Virginia witchcraft Web site for in-depth research. The site will contain all information available about the witchcraft trials and should serve as a warehouse for data on the hysteria. "People will be able to investigate demographic question like ... how many women we accused who had no sons or heirs to their property," Ray said.\nThe site will also feature maps and complete courtroom texts.\n\nTrask and other scholars act as consultants on the project, Ray said. It will be linked to the Danvers Archives site.\n\nReturn\n',

      '\nIATH takes scholarship into the 21st century\nBy Jon Bowen, A&S Online, September 2003\nIATH began in 1992 with a grant from IBM and a multi-year commitment of support from the University. The Institute -- which celebrates its 10 th anniversary in September with a scholarly symposium that will be open to the public -- now draws support from multiple corporations, foundations and individuals who contribute to projects.\n\nThe result is a multi-disciplinary forum that carries Thomas Jefferson\'s educational ideals into the Digital Age. Researchers in the arts and humanities are able to take advantage of sophisticated technical support and advanced computer technology to collaborate on projects that push the frontiers of scholarship.\n\nEvery year, the Institute awards one or more two-year fellowships. The fellowships are open to U.Va. professors as well as others in the academic community. Once fellows come on board with IATH, they have ready access to the staff of programmers, web designers and IT specialists on the Institute\'s staff.\n\nOne of IATH\'s newest additions is Stephen E. Plog, Commonwealth Professor of Anthropology at U.Va., who joins the Institute\'s roster of fellows this fall. With support from the Mellon Foundation, Plog will be collaborating with colleagues around the country on the creation of the Chaco Digital Research Archive.\n\nChaco Canyon, in northwestern New Mexico, was home to prehistoric Pueblo Indians from A.D. 850 to 1150.   The new archive will be built upon a relational database of architectural data from Chaco, complete with notes and drawings from field work in the region.\n\nChaco Canyon, in northwestern New Mexico, was home to prehistoric Pueblo Indians from A.D. 850 to 1150.   The new archive will be built upon a relational database of architectural data from Chaco, complete with notes and drawings from field work in the region.\n\n"The latter issue is particularly critical," Plog said, "because the Chaco data we\'ll be working with are now stored at several different institutions scattered around the country. A scholar interested in working with these data is faced with the expense of traveling to multiple locations. The archive will hopefully allow interested scholars to sit at their computers and work with all of the data, now linked electronically in a way that allows quick searches and queries."\n\nBut that\'s not all. Work on the Chaco archive could become a model for archaeological scholarship in the 21 st century.\n\n"If we can generalize these archive models," Plog said, "we can transform the way that all archaeological data are collected and stored. This in turn could revolutionize the discipline by allowing tremendous increases in the types of information available and in the ease of examining relations among types of data through the use of relational databases."\n\nPlog and his colleagues working on the Chaco project have a vision for the new archive, but they\'ll rely on IATH\'s technical experts to make their vision a reality.\n\n"The group of archaeologists working on the project has the expertise to conceptualize what the archive   should be," Plog said. "But we lack the knowledge and skills to move from that conceptualization. Our collaboration with the outstanding group at IATH will allow us to integrate the archaeological model with a digital conceptualization to develop the structure of the archive."\n\nRead More\n\nHome | Introduction | Press Archive | Overview',

      "\n\t\nThe Salem Witchcraft GIS\nA Visual Re-Creation of Salem in 1692\nBy Mike Furlough, Geospatial and Statistical Data Center\nPrimary Researcher: Benjamin Ray, University of Virginia\nAspects of the Project\nProgress and Schedule\n\nCreating the Salem Witchcraft GIS: Overview and Documentation\n\nSalem in March 1692: An Animated Presentation of the First Month\n\n[COMING SOON] The Putnam Family: Their Early Role in the Trials\n\nRelated Materials\nWitchcraft in Salem Village From the Electronic Text Center and the Danvers Archival Center\n\nThe Salem Witchcraft Papers\nVerbatim Transcripts of the Legal Documents of the Salem Witchcraft Outbreak of 1692. Edited by Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum\n\nThe GIS of \"Salem Village in 1692\" is part of an electronic Research Archive of primary source materials related to the Salem witch trials of 1692. The purpose of the GIS is twofold:\n\nFirst, the GIS gives visual representation of the social context of the witch trials episode by placing the nearly 300 people mentioned in the court records in their actual household locations in the Village. When completed, the database will hold the location of over 150 family households in Salem and surrounding communities. The documents also refer to conflicts between neighbors in the Village and to kinship ties among various families in the Village.\n\nSuch relationships are more easily grasped when the locations of the family members and households are displayed on a map. Important property disputes stand in the background of the Village's experience, among families later caught up in the witchcraft trials, and the map shows the disputed property boundries. Since the beginning of historical studies in the 19th century, scholars have used maps has the foundation of their interpretations of the causes of the conflict. This GIS will enable new forms of mapping to further study of the conflicts in Salem.\n\nSecond, the GIS is also able to represent in graphic form important demographic information, such as age, gender, frequency of accusations by various individuals, family relationships, relative wealth of accusers and accused -- all of which have played an important role in scholars' interpretations.\n\nCredits\nPrimary funding for this work is provided by The Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative.\n\nFurther support has been provided by: The Geospatial and Statistical Data Center (Geostat), University of Virginia Library, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanties (IATH), University of Virginia, and the Virginia Center for Digital History (VCDH), University of Virginia.\n\nPrimary Researcher: Benjamin Ray\nGIS Management: Mike Furlough (Geostat)\nGIS Technician: Heather Johnson\nShockwave Animation: Chris Jessee (IATH) & Jeff Evans (VCDH)\n\n© Copyright 1999 The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia",

I know, �twill cost you some time; but when you are sensible of the benefit that will follow, I know you will not think much of that cost. And my own willingness to expose myself unto the utmost, for the defense of my friends with you, makes me presume to plead something of merit to be considered.\n\nI shall be content if you draw up the desired narrative by way of letter to me; or at least, let it not come without a letter, wherein you shall, if you can, intimate over again, what you have sometimes told me, of the awe which is upon the hearts of your juries, with [respect?] unto the validity of the spectral evidences. Please also [torn] some of your observations about the confessors and [torn] the credibility of what they assert; or about things evidently preternatural in the witchcrafts, and whatever else you may account an entertainment, for an inquisitive person, that entirely loves you and Salem. Nay, tho� I will never lay aside the character which I mentioned in my last words, yet I am willing that when you write, you should imagine me as obstinate a Sadducee and witch-advocate as any among us; address me as one that believed in nothing reasonable; and when you have so knocked me down, in a specter so unlike me, you will enable me to box it about among my neighbors, till it come, I know not where, at last.\n\n�Sir, Your grateful friend,\n\n[Mentions in a postscript that Governor Phips himself prompted his request to Sewall.]",

      "\nHome\nArchives\nBooks & Diaries\nDocuments\nMaps\nPeople\nThe Diary of Samuel Sewall, 1674-1729\nSelected excerpts from Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Vol. 5, Series 5, 1878, pages 358 - 464.\n\nApril 11th 1692. Went to Salem, where, in the Meeting-house, the persons accused of Witchcraft were examined; was a very great Assembly; ëtwas awfull to see how the afflicted persons were agitated. Mr. Noyes prayíd at the beginning, and Mr. Higginson concluded. [In the margin], VÊ, VÊ, VÊ, Witchcraft.\n\nMay 24th 1692. First general Council, Saltonstall, Major Gedny, Walley, Hutchinson, Lothrop, Alcot, Sewall took their Oaths together, presently after Major Appleton took his. Justices of the Peace were nominated for the Province.\n\nJuly 20th 1692. Fast at the house of Capt. Alden, upon his account. Mr. Willard prayíd. I read a Sermon out of Dr. Preston, 1st and 2d Uses of Godís Alsufficiency. Capt. Scottow prayíd, Mr. Allen came in and prayíd, Mr. Cotton Mather, then Capt. Hill. Sung the first part 103.Ps., concluded about 5. aclock. Brave Shower of Rain while Capt. Scottow was praying, after much Drought. Cous. Daniel Gookin sups with us, and bespeaks my marrying of him tomorrow.\n\nJuly 30, 1692. Mrs. Cary makes her escape out of Cambridge ñPrison, who was Committed for Witchcraft.\n\nAugt. 19th 1692. This day the Liet. Governour, Major Phillips, Mr. Russel, Capt. Lynde and my self went to Watertown. Advisíd the Inhabitants at their Town-Meeting to settle a Minister; and if could not otherwise agree, should first have a Town-Meeting to decide where the Meetinghouse should be set. Many say Whitneyís Hill would be a convenient place.\n\nThis day [in the margin, Dolefull! Witchcraft] George Burrough, John Willard, Jno Procter, Martha Carrier and George Jacobs were executed at Salem, a very great number of Spectators being present. Mr. Cotton Mather was there, Mr. Sims, Hale, Noyes, Chiever, &c. All of them said they were innocent, Carrier and all. Mr. Mather says they all died by a Righteous Sentence. Mr. Burrough by his Speech, Prayer, protestation of his Innocence, did much move unthinking persons, which occasions their speaking hardly concerning his being executed.\n\nAugt. 25. Fast at the old [First] Church, respecting the Witchcraft, Drought, &c.\n\nMonday, Sept. 19, 1692. About noon, at Salem, Giles Corey was pressíd to death for standing Mute; much pains was used with him two days, one after another, by the Court and Capt. Gardner of Nantucket who had been of his acquaintance: but all in vain.\n\nSept. 20. Now I hear from Salem that about 18 years agoe, he was suspected to have stampd and pressíd a man to death, but was cleared. Twas not remembered till Anne Putnam was told of it by said Coreyís Spectre the Sabbath-day night before the Execution.\n\nSept. 21. A petition is sent to Town in behalf of Dorcas Hoar, who now confesses: Accordingly an order is sent to the Sheriff to forbear her Execution, notwithstanding her being in the Warrant to die to morrow. This is the first condemned person who has confessíd.\n\nThorsday, Sept. 22, 1692. William Stoughton, Esqr., John Hathorne, Esqr., Mr. Cotton Mather, and Capt. John Higginson, with my Brother St., were at our house, speaking about publishing some Trials of the Witches. Mr. Stoughton went away and left us, it began to rain and was very dark, so that getting some way beyond the fortification, was fain to come back again, and lodgd here in Capt. Henchmanís Room. Has been a plentiful Rain, blessed be God. Mr. Stoughton went away early in the morn so that I saw him not. Read the 1 Jno 1. before went to bed.\n\nOct. 11, 1692. Went to the Funeral of Mrs. Sarah Oliver, widow, aged 72. years; buried in the new burying place; a very good, modest, humble, plain, liberal Matron. Bearers, Sam. Sewall, Major Jno Walley, Capt. Joshua Scottow, Capt. James Hill, Capt. Jacob Eliot, Capt. Theophilus Frary. Scarvs and Gloves.\n\nRead Mr. Willardís Epistle to Mr. Matherís book, as to Cases of Conscience touching Witchcraft.\n\nSatterday, Oct. 15th Went to Cambridge and visited Mr. Danforth, and discoursed with Him about the Witchcraft; thinks there cannot be a procedure in the Court except there be some better consent of Ministers and People. Told me of the womanís coming into his house last Sabbath-day sennight at Even.\n\nOct. 26, 1692. A Bill is sent in about calling a Fast, and Convocation of Ministers, that may be led in the right way as to the Witchcrafts. The season and manner of doing it, us such, that the Court of Oyer and Terminer count themselves thereby dismissed. 29 Nos, and 33 yeas to the Bill. Capt. Bradstreet and Lieut. True, Wm Huchins and several other interested persons there, in the affirmative.\n\nNov. 22, 1692. I prayd that God would pardon all my Sinfull Wanderings, and direct me for the future. That God would bless the Assembly in their debates, and that would chse and assist our Judges, &c., and save New England as to Enemies and Witchcrafts, and vindicate the late Judges, consisting with his Justice and Holiness, &c., with Fasting. Cousin Anne Quinsy visited me in the Evening, and told me of her childrenís wellfare. Now about, Mercy Short grows ill again, as formerly.\n\nMonday, June 12, 1693. I visit Capt. Alden and his wife, and tell them I was sorry for their Sorrow and Temptations by reason of his Imprisonment, and that was glad of his Restauration.\n\nFourth-day Augt 12, 1696. Mr. Melyen, upon a slight occasion, spoke to me very smartly about the Salem Witchcraft: in discourse he said, if a man should take Beacon hill on ës back, carry it away; and then bring it and set it in its place again, he should not make any thing of that.\n\n7r 16. Keep a day of Prayer in the East end of the Town-House, Govr, Council and Assembly. Mr. Morton begun with Prayer, Mr. Allin prayíd, Mr. Willard preachedóIf God be with us who can be against us?óSpake smartly at last about the Salem Witchcrafts, and that no order had been sufferíd to come forth by Authority to ask Gods pardon.\n\nCopy of the Bill I put up on the Fast day; giving it to Mr. Willard as he passíd by, and standing up at the reading of it, and bowing when finished; in the Afternoon.\n\nSamuel Sewall, sensible of the reiterated strokes of God upon himself and family; and being sensible, that as to the Guilt contracted, upon the opening of the late Commission of Oyer and Terminer at Salem (to which the order for this Day relates) he is, upon many accounts, more concerned than any that he knows of, Desires to take the Blame and Shame of it, Asking pardon of Men, And especially desiring prayers that God, who has an Unlimited Authority, would pardon that sin and all other his sins; personal and Relative: And according to his infinite Benignity, and Soveraignty, Not Visit the Sin of him, or of any other, upon himself or any of his, nor upon the Land: But that He would powerfully defend him against all Temptations to Sin, for the future; and vouchsafe him the efficacious, saving Conduct of his Word and Spirit.\n\nSixth-day, Novr 19. Mr. Higginson coms as far as Brothers to see me; which I wonderíd at.

      "\nThursday November 4th, 1999.\n©www.salemnews.com, 1999\nDocuments shed new light on witchcraft trials\nBy Betsy Taylor\nOriginally published in the Salem Evening News\nNovember 4, 1999\nDANVERS - More than three centuries after the Salem witch trials, scholars have discovered a handful of documents that reveal the hysteria continued longer than previously thought and identify a new man among those accused.\n\nAn international effort is underway to re-transcribe papers relating to the witch hunts, with Danvers' town archivist Dick Trask serving as an associate editor. That book, and one other, will contain the new finds.\n\nScholars, by meticulously scouring archives this decade, have quietly added about 3 percent more official documentation to the collection relating to the 1692 proceedings, Trask said.\n\nWitchcraft experts are particularly excited by discoveries of the past year.\n\n\"I think all of them are valuable, and I think some of them are pretty significant,\" said Bernard Rosenthal, a State University of New York at Binghamton professor. \"It gives fresh insight.''\n\nRosenthal is the editor of a project to compile all the witch trial legal documentation into a new book.\n\nWhen a group of girls and young women first accused townsfolk in Salem and its environs of being witches in the 17th century, a paper trail started which is still surfacing in the modern day.\n\nOne document, found within the past year, reveals that the zeal of Salem witchcraft accusations went on longer than historians had previously thought.\n\nEven after the last of 19 hangings -- and after the governor had ordered a stop to the witch proceedings -- one teenage girl who had already accused 21 people of being witches continued to officially make further accusations, scholars have found.\n\nAnother identifies a new man, Daniel Eames, as being among the 144 people formally arrested and charged with witchcraft.\n\n\"Now there's another name to add to the list of the accused at Salem,\" said Cornell University American History Professor Mary Beth Norton, who found those documents. She's working on her own book about the witch trials.\n\nShe found four previously unknown manuscripts at the Massachusetts Historical Society by searching through a miscellaneous manuscripts file.\n\nHearing from the accused\n\nIn July, a University of Virginia professor Benjamin C. Ray came across two newly discovered examinations, or written accounts, of the questions asked of accused witches, which give gripping details into two women's ordeals for the first time.\n\nOne of the accused, Mrs. Ann Dolliver, admits to making puppets out of wax, but denies being a witch. Her accuser retorts that Dolliver's specter said she wanted to kill her own father and killed a little child.\n\nIn another newly found examination, a woman, Mary Ireson, stands stunned in the courtroom, her \"eyes being fixed,\" after one of her accusers says Ireson's spirit threatened to tear out her accuser's throat if she did not become a witch by signing her name in the Devil's book.\n\n\"We never heard their voices before. This gives us a little more of the picture,\" said Ray. He's working on an interactive Witchcraft Web site. He found Dolliver and Ireson's examinations during his research at the Boston Public Library.\n\nBoth professors said their finds were not due to poor archiving, rather the result of thorough, directed research.\n\nThey've shared their discoveries with other scholars but have just gone public with the finds. The newly found documents will likely be included in a new volume, a re-transcribed and chronologically arranged collection of Salem witchcraft trial documents.\n\nOver the past few years, these four witchcraft scholars, researching separately but updating one another on their efforts, have found about 3 percent more documentation to add to the approximately 850 known Salem witch trial records, explained Trask, the Danvers town archivist, historian and writer.\n\nHe's one of those who have made discoveries during recent years.\n\nThe town of Danvers was known as Salem Village in the 17th century, its archives are one of the sites where some of the historic documents are stored.\n\nTrask found 19 documents, which he published as part of his 1997 book. Rosenthal found one, which he printed in his 1993 book.\n\nThe most recent attempt to transcribe all the documents occurred in the 1930s as part of a Work Projects Administration program when people were put to work during the Great Depression. It was published in 1977 but scholars said mistakes need to be corrected and new finds added.\n\nThis new edition of the Salem witch trial documents is scheduled to be published by Cambridge University Press in a few years. Norton is writing her own book, \"In the Devil's Snare,\" which focuses more on the accusers and why the authorities were willing to listen to them.\n\nAs a Colonial history professor, Norton said them are three places in 17th century American history that people particularly recall: Plymouth, Jamestown, and Salem.\n\nShe said the phrase Salem Witch Trial still resonates with Americans, and the fascination with the trials remains. \"I think everybody's interested in Salem,\" she said.\n\nRay said he thinks people will continue to be interested, seeking answers to their own questions about the trials. \"We keep returning to it.\" he noted. \"Its something we're not satisfied that we understand.\"\n\n© 1999, Salem Evening News",

Edited by Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum\n\nThe GIS of \"Salem Village in 1692\" is part of an electronic Research Archive of primary source materials related to the Salem witch trials of 1692. The purpose of the GIS is twofold:\n\nFirst, the GIS gives visual representation of the social context of the witch trials episode by placing the nearly 300 people mentioned in the court records in their actual household locations in the Village. When completed, the database will hold the location of over 150 family households in Salem and surrounding communities. The documents also refer to conflicts between neighbors in the Village and to kinship ties among various families in the Village.\n\nSuch relationships are more easily grasped when the locations of the family members and households are displayed on a map. Important property disputes stand in the background of the Village's experience, among families later caught up in the witchcraft trials, and the map shows the disputed property boundries. Since the beginning of historical studies in the 19th century, scholars have used maps has the foundation of their interpretations of the causes of the conflict. This GIS will enable new forms of mapping to further study of the conflicts in Salem.\n\nSecond, the GIS is also able to represent in graphic form important demographic information, such as age, gender, frequency of accusations by various individuals, family relationships, relative wealth of accusers and accused -- all of which have played an important role in scholars' interpretations.\n\nCredits\nPrimary funding for this work is provided by The Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative.\n\nFurther support has been provided by: The Geospatial and Statistical Data Center (Geostat), University of Virginia Library, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanties (IATH), University of Virginia, and the Virginia Center for Digital History (VCDH), University of Virginia.\n\nPrimary Researcher: Benjamin Ray\nGIS Management: Mike Furlough (Geostat)\nGIS Technician: Heather Johnson\nShockwave Animation: Chris Jessee (IATH) & Jeff Evans (VCDH)\n\nLAST MODIFIED:\nTHIS SITE MAINTAINED BY: geostat@virginia.edu\n\n© Copyright 1999 The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia",

      "\nSalem Possessed:\nThe Social Origins of Witchcraft\nReviewed by Kate Murphy\n\nSalem Witch Trials in History and Literature\nAn Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia\nSpring Semester 2001\n\nPaul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum's Salem Possessed explores the pre-existing social and economic divisions within the Salem Village community, as an entry point to understand the accusations of witchcraft in 1692. According to Boyer and Nissenbaum, the village split into two factions: one interested in gaining more autonomy for Salem Village and led by the Putnam family, and the other, interested in the mercantile and political life of Salem Town and led by the Porter family. Boyer and Nissenbaum's deft and imaginative look at local records reveals the contours of communal life in colonial New England and provides a model through which to understand the witchcraft accusations as part of a larger pattern of communal strife. Such a tight focus on communal and social causes for the events of 1692, however, loses sight of the religious, gendered, and individual forces that played equally pivotal roles in the outbreak.\n\nPaul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum's Salem Possessed: The Social Origins of Witchcraft redefined the standard for the possibilities social history offers to understand the events and people of early America. Through a painstaking and creative look at local records such as legal records, the Salem Village record book, the minister's book, and tax records Boyer and Nissenbaum discovered a long-standing pattern of contentious behavior of which the witchcraft accusations in 1692 was just one episode. Their analysis provides an invaluable insight into the social history of New England generally, and the factions of Salem Village that led to the tragic events of 1692, in particular.\n\nBoyer and Nissenbaum's explanation for the outbreak of witchcraft accusations in Salem hinges on an understanding of the economic, political and personal issues which divided village long before 1692. At bottom, geography and history divided Salem Village and Salem Town. Situated in the interior from the bustling mercantile town of Salem, Salem Village remained primarily an agricultural community. Boyer and Nissenbaum argue that this polarization of interests between the town and the village created a similar divide within the village itself. One faction, led by the Putnam family, most identified itself with the traditional agricultural activities of the village and consequently supported the village minister, Samuel Parris, and the drive for greater autonomy from Salem Town. The opposing faction, led by the Porter family, identified itself with the mercantile town, near which most of the Porter faction lived. In opposition to the Putnam faction, the Porters opposed the minister and wanted greater association with the town of Salem. The bitter and contentious disputes between the two factions within Salem Village both before and after the witchcraft outbreak, demonstrate a pattern of communal conflict which transcended the events of 1692.\n\nThese same fault-lines, according to Boyer and Nissenbaum, explain the pattern of witchcraft accusations. The same villagers who stood with the Putnams to support Parris and petition for an independent church for the village, show up as complaints on witchcraft indictments in 1692. Similarly, many of the accused witches in Salem belonged to the Porter faction or, according to Boyer and Nissenbaum, represented the projection of the grievances caused by such factionalism upon more obtainable targets like Rebecca Nurse and Martha Cory. Through such a reconstruction of the factional village of Salem, Boyer and Nissenbaum explain the Salem witchcraft episode from within the larger history of the transformation to a modern capitalist society, and the divisions and conflicts that naturally arose from this change.\n\nBoyer and Nissenbaum's intensive focus on the dynamics of Salem Village blind them to other dynamics contributing to the witchcraft outbreak. Although the outbreak originated in Salem Village, the majority of the accused hailed from surrounding villages such as Andover, removed from the Putnam/Porter disputes and known for its harmonious community life. As Bernard Rosenthal points out, \"the study stops short of inquiring into why the outbreak spread throughout Massachusetts Bay and caught in its net people having nothing to do with the quarrels of that particular village.\" The dynamics of village dispute can help to explain the origin of the outbreak, but cannot explain why this outbreak became an epidemic.\n\n\nBoyer and Nissenbaum's almost exclusive focus on the socio-economic dimensions to the witchcraft episode obscures the importance of individuals and of Puritan religious beliefs. In his review of Salem Possessed, T.H. Breen argues that Boyer and Nissenbaum \"assume a direct causal relationship between socio-economic conditions and individual behavior. Indeed, the authors manage to trace almost all personal motivation back to the pocketbook.\" While their deft reconstruction of Salem Village's factious society and the economic changes which contributed to such divides is quite convincing, the intellectual jump they make to connect these pre-existing divisions with the personal motivations of accusers is largely speculative and circumstantial. Boyer and Nissenbaum's analysis of communal conflict also omits the religious ideas behind the trials - the very ideas which the people of Salem would have believed to be most important. Writing forty-five years before Boyer and Nissenbaum, Perry Miller believed that \"I do not need to demonstrate that belief in witchcraft was, for the seventeenth century, not only plausible but scientifically rational,\" because in 1939 Miller believed that the subject was well rehearsed. After the publication of Salem Possessed, however, we could use such a rehearsal. Miller's work demonstrated the logic of a Puritan theology which numbered witches and demonical presences as among the punishments God could inflict upon his inattentive people. Taking the theological and cosmological logic of the Puritans into account allows the Salem outbreak to be understood in its own terms, rather than simply in terms of economic rationalization and communal strife.\n\nAny complete understanding of the Salem witchcraft accusations most also attempt to explain why the vast majority of accused witches were women. Carol Karlsen included Salem Possessed in her critique of histories of Salem which, \"note that witches were usually women, most works pass over the fact quickly or conclude that witches were scapegoats for hostilities and tensions that had little to do with sex or gender.\" Although the directions the accusations took undoubtedly reflected pre-existing tensions within the community, Karlsen argues that the accusations also reflected societal ideas about women and the ways men reconciled changes in gender roles.\n\nAlthough the intensity of Boyer and Nissenbaum's focus on Salem Village obscured forces foundational to a complete understanding of the events of 1692, through Salem Possessed, in the words of one reviewer, \"new stage in our understanding of the dynamics of the processes of community development and social conflicts has been reached.\" Boyer and Nissenbaum help us to understand not only the ways in which the outbreak of accusations in Salem was part of a larger pattern of communal conflict, but also serve to warn us that the divisive powers such conflicts have the potential to instigate modern witch hunts.\n\nBack to Scholarship\n\n© Copyright 2002 by Benjamin Ray and The Rector and Visitors of the\nUniversity of Virginia",

The accusations began with two young girls who lived in the home of the Rev. Samuel Parris. Prior conflicts within the village had caused the departure of three ministers in the past sixteen years. Almost immediately after Rev. Parris\'s arrival in 1689, conflicts arose among villagers concerned about the benefits Parris was to receive, including ownership of the parsonage. In 1692 a new Village committee opposed to Parris was elected. Parris\'s salary was not paid for months, and he began to run out of money and firewood. In January,1692, Parris\'s 9 year-old daughter Betty Parris and her 12 year-old cousin Abigail Williams began to behave erratically and exhibit extreme physical contortions. Their actions were similar to that of the Goodwin children in Boston who had fallen into fits and accused a servant woman named Glover of bewitching them. Glover was later convicted and hanged as a witch. The Goodwin case and the children\'s\' "afflicted" behavior were described in detail in a widely read book, Memorable Providences, written by Rev. Cotton Mather, a prominent Boston minister, and published in 1689.\n\nIn Salem Village the Rev. Parris and other local ministers were unable to remedy the girls\' behavior through prayer. Doctor William Griggs, a village physician, was consulted, and he pronounced the girls to be suffering from the "Evil Hand." Several young friends of Betty Parris and Abigail Williams, also exhibited similar behavior. They were all children of influential families in the Village and supporters of Rev. Parris: Ann Putnam, Jr., daughter of Sgt. Thomas Putnam, Elizabeth Hubbard, grand niece of William Griggs, Mercy Lewis, a servant in the home of Thomas Putnam, and Mary Walcott, daughter of Capt. Jonathan Walcott. A neighbor, Mary Sibley, secretly resorted to a well-known magical procedure. She told Parris\'s slave, John Indian, to make a witch\'s cake, using some of the girls\' urine, and to feed it to a dog to discover the names of the witches afflicting them. Subsequently, the girls began to name people in the Village. The first to be accused were easy targets of social prejudice: Sarah Good, a homeless mother and beggar, Tituba, the Indian slave of the Rev. Parris; and Sarah Osburn, a woman whose marriage and inheritance dispute attracted disfavor. Titbua, the first to be examined by the magistrates, admitted that she had been beaten by Rev. Parris and told to confess. She confessed volubly and in great detail to an alliance with the Devil, and she named Osburn and Good as witches. Sarah Good also accused Sarah Osburn before the magistrates. Tituba\'s confession and Good\'s confirmation Osburn\'s involvement convinced the ministers and magistrates of a local conspiracy with the Devil. Bolder accusations followed. Emboldened, the girls accused Martha Cory and Rebecca Nurse, both respected members of the church. At the end of March, people in nearby Ipswich accused Rachel Clinton, an abandoned wife, who had previously been accused of witchcraft. All were jailed on charges of witchcraft and shackled with iron fetters.\n\nThe newly appointed governor Sir William Phips returned from England in the middle of May. He arrived with a new royal charter and was empowered to govern. With dozens of accused witches filling the jails and with more accusations threatening to overwhelm the local courts, Governor Phips established a special court of Oyer and Terminer ("to hear and determine") to try the backlog of cases. In June, the first to be executed was Bridget Bishop, an outspoken woman who had been accused of witchcraft twelve years earlier. The accusations continued and began to spread outside Salem Village, filling the jails in Salem, Boston, Cambridge, and Ipswich. Accusations also began to spread up the social ladder to people of high social status, such as Salem\'s richest merchant, Philip English, and the famed sea Captain John Alden. The most active accusers lived in Salem Village, and this community suffered the most from executions, while the people of Andover sustained the largest number of accusations.\n\n\nThe court of Oyer and Terminer was headed by Lieutenant Governor William Stoughton, appointed by Governor Phips. Stoughton supported the validity of spectral evidence used by the girls and young women in their accusations. A "specter" was the image of a person visible only to the witchcraft victim whom the specter was said to have attacked in some way. The use of spectral evidence was common in New England witchcraft trials, but never played a decisive role. The Rev. Cotton Mather, writing on behalf of several Boston ministers, advised caution in relying on such evidence but at the same time urged the court to undertake "the speedy and vigorous prosecution" of anyone guilty of witchcraft. In the Salem, spectral evidence was used to initiate legal complaints, alleging harmful pinching or choking, in order to bring people into court on charges of witchcraft, with the presumption of guilt. As the documents reveal, the magistrates were successful in obtaining dozens of confessions of witchcraft, which meant testifying to having made a covenant with the Devil. The records show that 47 people confessed to witchcraft, and many did so when it was apparent that confession would put off a trial. This was an unprecedented exception to the law pertaining to capital offenses. Much persuasion and some torture was used to make people confess to a covenant with the Devil. All those who confessed were saved, whereas those who maintained their innocence were executed. This, again, was unprecedented legal procedure. When some confessors recanted their false confessions, for reasons of conscience, serious doubts about the confessions of others were raised, and the legal process called into question.\n\nIn early October, the Rev Increase Mather, minister of North Church and President of Harvard College, together with other ministers in Boston, such as the Rev. Samuel Willard, prevailed upon Governor Phips to stop the proceedings of the special court in Salem and to disallow the use of spectral evidence. Public opinion was also changing, as indicated in a famous letter by Thomas Brattle. Without the admission of spectral evidence and without the court room performances of the "afflicted" girls, convictions of witchcraft soon came to an end. In January, Phips appointed the Superior Court of Judicature to try the backlog of cases and begin clearing the jails. In a letter of explanation sent to England, Eventually, Phips wrote a letter of explanation to the Crown saying that he stopped the trials because "I saw many innocent persons might otherwise perish. Phips cited his absence from Boston while fighting Indians and the zealousness of Stoughton for allowing the Salem trials get out of hand.\n\nAftermath\n\nDespite strong opposition, Samuel Parris clung to his position as the pastor of Salem Village, admitting too late that "I may have been mistaken." He was forced to leave the Village in 1696. In 1697 a Day of Repentance was declared in Boston. On that day Samuel Sewall, a prominent magistrate on the court of Oyer and Terminer, rose from his seat in South Church to confess the "blame and shame" of the witch trials in a statement read by Rev.Samuel Willard. Twelve jurors who also served on that court confessed to "the guilt of innocent blood." Years later, in 1706 Ann Putnam, Jr, one of the most active accusers, stood in her pew before the Salem Village church while the Rev. Joseph Green read her confession of "delusion" by the devil.\n\nIn 1711, the courts of Massachusetts Bay began to make monetary restitution to the families of those who were jailed. The names of some of those condemned and executed were cleared; and the process of clearing names of the condemned from the court records continues today.\n\n\nHome | Introduction | Press Archive| Overview',

      '\nHome\nArchives\nBooks & Letters\nDocuments\nMaps\nPeople\nImportant Persons in the Salem Court Records\n\n\nBridget Bishop\nBridget Bishop was the first person to be executed during the Salem witchcraft trials. In Salem folklore, she is portrayed as a feisty, fun-loving, lusty, innkeeper who can\'t seem to keep herself out of trouble. Recently, historians have painted a somewhat different picture, owing to the confusion with Sarah Bishop who also appears in the court records of the witch trials. Indisputably, the Bridget Bishop who was tried and hanged possessed a quick wit and independent spirit that could not be crushed by the court of Oyer and Terminer.\n\nImages+\nFull Essay+\nCourtroom Exam+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nGeorge Burroughs\nGeorge Burroughs was the only Puritan minister indicted and executed in Salem in 1692. He served as minister of Salem Village from 1680 until he left in 1683. As one of the succession of three ministers who left the Village in the years leading up to the trials, he became involved in the Village\'s social conflicts. During his stay in Salem he borrowed money from the Putnam family and when he was unable to pay it back, conflict with the Putnams arose. It was at this point that he left. Although he eventually repaid his loan, twelve years later, he was charged, arrested and brought back to Salem from Wells, Maine. Many members of the Salem Village and Andover testified against him and called him the "ring leader" of the witches, a virtual priest of the devil. Cotton Mather also took particular interest in the trial because of Burroughs\' unorthodox religious beliefs and practices. He was found guilty and executed on August 19, 1692. His hanging was the only one attended by Cotton Mather, who urged the sympathetic crowd against him.\n\nImages+\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nMartha Carrier\nCalling her a "rampant hag" and the "Queen of Hell," the Reverend Cotton Mather harbored no doubts that Martha Carrier deserved to be executed as a witch during the Salem outbreak on August 19, 1692. The Salem documents themselves, however, reveal that her crime was not witchcraft but an independence of mind and an unsubmissive character. A daughter of one of the founding families of Andover, Martha married a young Welsh servant, Thomas Carrier, in 1674, by whom she had four children. The Salem accusation against Martha came only two years after the selectmen of Andover blamed a smallpox epidemic on her witchcraft. Although historians have blamed her accusation on causes ranging from a conspiracy against Andover\'s proprietary families to reaction against threats to patriarchal inheritance, her contentious spirit and the earlier charge of witchcraft seem the most plausible explanation.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nGiles Corey\nAnn Putnam, Jr., Marcy Lewis, Abigail Williams, Mary Walcott and Elizabeth Hubbard accused Giles Corey of witchcraft in April of 1692. He pleaded "not guilty" but refused to be tried by the court which, in his view, had already determined his guilt, so he stood mute rather "putting himself on the country." He was sentenced to peine forte et dure, even though it was an illegal punishment, and ended up being torturously crushed to death on (or before) September 18, 1692. One of the major factors which made Giles Corey a prime target was not only his relationship with the rest of the community but also his past encounters with the law, including a prior conviction for murder. His chosen means of resistance and dramatic death reveal a strength of character that playwrights, from Longfellow to Arthur Miller, have found irresistible.\n\nImages+\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nMartha Cory\nThe accusation of Martha Corey marked a turning point in the Salem witch trials crisis of 1692 in Massachusetts. Corey was a newly accepted member of the village church and broke the established mold of only social pariahs being accused of practicing witchcraft. Major contributing factors to the case being brought against her were an illegitimate son born to Corey in the 1670s, and her outspoken criticisms of the trials and the judges involved in the convictions. Although Martha espoused her innocence throughout her whole ordeal, she was put to death on September 22, 1692.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nMary Easty\nThe story of Mary Easty, the 58-year-old sister of Rebecca Nurse and Sarah Cloyce from Topsfield usually draws the portrait, now legendary, of a courageous martyr fighting for her innocence. Her case gives insight into the workings of the trials, and her eloquent and legally astute petitions have been said to help bring them to an end.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nSarah Good\nSarah Good was born to a prosperous innkeeper in 1653. However, her father\'s estate became entangled in litigation leaving Sarah Good in poverty. After the death of her first husband, she married William Good. The Goods lived a life of begging and poverty in Salem Village. Sarah was regarded as an unsavory person and has come to be regarded through literature as the stereotypical witch, a disreputable old hag. Good was among the first three women accused of witchcraft in 1692 and was the first to testify. She never confessed guilt, but, like Tituba, she did accuse Sarah Osburne, an act that was credited with validating the witchcraft trials and accusations. Good was hanged as a witch on Tuesday July 19, 1692, but not until after the imprisonment of her six year old child Dorcas, also accused of witchcraft, and the tragic death of her infant in prison.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nElizabeth How\n\n\nGeorge Jacobs, Sr.\nGeorge Jacobs, Sr. was about 72 years old when he was hanged as a wizard on August 19, 1692, along with three other men and one woman -- the first time men were executed for witchcraft in Salem. He was accused, among many others, by his granddaughter, Margaret Jacobs who was also accused and imprisoned. Depending on scholarly opinion, he has been seen as the victim of personal grudges, the casualty of the socio-political climate of Salem, or the target of cultural system\'s effects on young, socially subordinate women.\n\nImages+\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nSusannah Martin\nThe sixty-seven year old widow Susannah Martin of Amesbury was hanged as a witch on July 19, 1692 on the basis of the testimony of the accusing circle of girls of Salem Village and other neighbors. Although she maintained her innocence to the end, a previous history of witchcraft accusations and the momentum of Salem\'s accusations carried her to the gallows. Martin figures in historian Carol Karlsen\'s account of the Salem outbreak as an example of a woman who was easily targeted as a threat to the orderly transmission of property down the paternal line because of Martin\'s role in an ongoing court dispute over her father\'s will.\n\nImages+\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nRebecca Nurse\nRebecca Nurse was an elderly and respected member of the Salem Village community. She was accused of witchcraft by several of the "afflicted" girls in the Village in March of 1692. Although a large number of friends, neighbors and family members wrote petitions testifying to her innocence, she was tried for acts of witchcraft in June, 1692. The jury first returned a "not guilty" verdict, but was told to reconsider, and then brought in a verdict of "guilty." Governor Phips pardoned her, but was later persuaded to reverse his decision by several men from Salem. She was excommunicated from the Salem church and hanged on July 19, 1692. Her house in Danvers, the former Salem village, still stands and is open to visitors. A large monument also marks her grave in the Nurse family cemetery on the grounds.\n\nImages+\nCourtroom Exam+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nAlice Parker\n\n\nMary Parker\nMary Ayer Parker of Andover came to trial in Salem Massachusetts, suspected of witchcraft. During her examination she was asked, "How long have ye been in the snare of the devil?" She responded, "I know nothing of it." Many people confessed under the pressure of the court of Oyer and Terminer, but she asserted the court had the wrong woman. "There is another woman of the same name in Andover," she proclaimed.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nJohn Proctor\nJohn Proctor was an elderly man of 60 years of age when accused, tried, and hanged for practicing witchcraft in 1692. Maintaining his innocence until death, he challenged the court to reexamine the validity of spectral evidence. Though it did not save him, his legacy is remembered in Arthur Miller\'s play The Crucible. Though not an historically accurate depiction, The Crucible does bring attention to the story of John Proctor and his struggle as an innocent man.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nAnn Pudeator\nExecuted on Sept. 22, 1692, the widow Ann Greenslit Pudeator was one of the seven unfortunate victims of the final hanging on Gallows Hill during the Salem witch trials. Highlights from her trial included the usual testimony of the circle of accusing girls that Ann had afflicted them in "spectral" form. John Best, Sr. also accused Ann of having murdered his wife, whom Ann had served as a nurse. Mary Warren went to the extreme of implicating Pudeator in the deaths of four people. Historian Carol Karlsen speculates that Pudeator may have been targeted due to her profession as a midwife that placed her in direct competition with male care providers, as well as her defiance of the Puritan female gender ideal of meekness and submission to male authority. Although the details of Ann Pudeator\'s birth are unknown, it is estimated that she was between 70 and 75 when she was hanged, still protesting her innocence at the hands of false accusations.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nWilmot Redd\n\n\nMargaret Scott\nThe witchcraft accusations and trial of Margaret Scott, executed on September 22nd, 1692, long have been a mystery to historians. With the recently located depositions from her examination, the people, places, and events associated with Margaret Scott\'s trial can now be examined and the mystery surrounding her can be solved.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nSamuel Wardwell\nSamuel Wardwell was born on May 16, 1643 to a modest Quaker family in Boston. He studied carpentry and moved to Andover, Massachusetts in 1672 to find work. There he married his second wife, Sarah Hawkes, a wealthy widow with whom he had seven children. In 1692, he was accused of witchcraft and brought to trial in Salem. The fact he was found guilty is not surprising, as he had dabbled in fortune telling as a young man, had family members who were disliked in Andover, and had married a woman whom many did not think he was worthy of marrying. During his court examination, he confessed to being a witch by submitting a long and detailed story of his indiscretions in order to save his life. His conscience and personal courage led him to recant the story and claim innocence, knowing the risk involved. He was hanged on September 22, 1692.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nSarah Wilds\n\n\nJohn Willard\nJohn Willard was accused of witchcraft at the end of April 1692, after refusing to arrest people that he believed were innocent. One of his main accusers was his wife\'s grandfather, Bray Wilkins, who claimed that after a mean look from Willard, he became immediately sick. While Wilkins\' symptoms suggest that he was most likely suffering from kidney stones, his assumption that he had been bewitched is evidence of the widespread fear that occurred in Salem during withc trials. Willard was hanged on August 19, 1692, maintaining his innocence until his death.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nAnn Foster\n\n\nInfant Girl (daughter of Sarah Good)\n\n\nSarah Osborne\nIn February of 1692, Sarah Osborne became one of the first three victims to be accused of witchcraft in Salem Village. As the widow of Robert Prince-a Salem Villager who purchased a 150-acre farm next to his friend Captain John Putnam\'s, Osborne was required (by Prince\'s will) to carry-over their estate to their two young sons. However, by attempting to overtake possession of the property for herself and her new husband, Irish immigrant Alexander Osborne, Sarah Osborne upset social norms that consequently resulted in accusations of witchcraft by the Putnam family. She died in prison on May 10, 1692.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nSir William Phips\nSir William Phips was appointed Governor of Massachusetts just prior to the Salem Witchcraft Trials of 1692. Phips created the special witchcraft Court of Oyer and Terminer, and subsequently dismantled it after the Boston ministers and the general public turned against the trials. It is difficult to dismiss the view that he might have stopped the trials sooner had he overseen the court more closely, instead of leaving it entirely in the hands of his zealous deputy Govenor William Stoughton, the chief justice of the court.\n\nImages+\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\nJonathan Corwin\n\n\nThomas Danforth\n\n\nBartholomew Gedney\n\n\nJohn Hathorne\nBorn into a well-established Salem family on August 5, 1641, John Hathorne became a local Salem magistrate and was chosen by Governor Sir William Phips to be a judge in the Salem Witch Trials. During the trials, Hathorne took on the role of a prosecutor rather than an impartial judge. Hathorne\'s questioning always began with a presumption of guilt rather than innocence, and he appeared to be on the side of the accusers. Hathorne altered the tradition of previous witch trials by encouraging those under examination not only to confess to witchcraft but also to name others who might be witches - a move that accelerated the number of accusations. He died in Salem on May 10, 1717, and was later a prominent target of criticism by his own great-grandson, Nathaniel Hawthorne.\n\nImages+\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nJohn Richards\n\n\nNathaniel Saltonstall\n\n\nPeter Sargent\n\n\nSamuel Sewall\nBorn in England in 1652, Samuel Sewall moved to America at the age of nine and obtained two degrees from Harvard before marrying into a wealthy family. As a prominent member of the merchant class, Sewall was selected by Governor Phips to sit as a judge for the witchcraft trials on the Court of Oyer and Terminer. Five years after the trials concluded, Sewall issued a public confession demonstrating personal remorse, taking in his words the "Blame and Shame" for his part in condemning innocent people. He was the only judge to do so.\n\nImages+\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nWilliam Stoughton\nLieutenant Governor William Stoughton was appointed Chief Justice of the court of Oyer and Terminer in 1692. He ruled over the trials with the determination to eradicate all witches from Massachusetts Bay Colony - heavily influenced by his conservative religious convictions. When the court was dissolved, Stoughton continued to enjoy political success and never apologized for his role in the trials.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nStephen Sewall\n\n\nWait Winthrop\n\n\nThomas Brattle\nThomas Brattle (1658 - 1713) was a well-educated and prosperous Boston merchant who served as treasurer of Harvard College, and was a member of the intellectually elite Royal Society. In early October 1692 he wrote a letter to an English clergyman which was critical of the Salem witch trials. The letter was circulated widely in Boston at the time, and it continues to be studied for its reasoned attack on the witchcraft trials in Salem. Brattle presents a compelling argument against the legal premises and procedures involved in the afflictions, accusations, and executions, with a particular focus on the validity of spectral evidence in proceedings. He was careful not to argue against the motives of the "Salem Gentlemen" as he calls the judges and ministers at the helm, but rather against the methods they employed. He concludes by saying "I am afraid that ages will not wear off that reproach and those stains which these things will leave behind them upon out land."\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFrancis Dane\nFrancis Dane was born about 1615 in England and died on February 16, 1607 at the age of eighty-one in Andover, Massachusetts. Dane was the elderly senior pastor of Andover and a highly respected leader of the community. In 1682, the congregation hired a young Harvard graduate Rev. Thomas Bernard to aid Rev. Dane with his ministerial duties in his old age. There was tension between the two about their salaries, and the two ministers reacted very differently to the witch trials of 1692. Initially, Bernard did much to aid the accusations of witchcraft in Andover, while Dane had more of his family members accused than any other family in 1692. Furthermore, it was Dane\'s early October petitions to the General Court for pardons, writing against spectral evidence, filing of slander suits, and bold stance against the witchcraft trials that are credited with ending the proceedings in Andover so quickly. Dane is still regarded as the hero of Andover during the Witch Trials of 1692.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nDeodat Lawson\n\n\nCotton Mather\nCotton Mather, one of the most famous (and infamous) figures in the history of Puritan New England, was a complex man of great influence upon American history and the discourse that accompanied the Salem witch trials in the years following 1692. As a prominent Bostonian minister, author, and born on Feb. 12th 1663 as the son of the Harvard president Increase Mather, Cotton\'s reputation as a stalwart believer in the direct influence of the devil upon the physical world through the spiritual realm was already in place by the start of the witch trials. Consulted by three of the five judges, and friends with all of the major authorities involved, Cotton\'s self-contradicting positions on the use of spectral evidence and the prosecution of the Salem witches heavily swayed the directions of the trial proceedings and the executions. Cotton was also appointed as the somewhat reluctant first historian of the trials, through the commissioning of his book, The Wonders of the Invisible World, that served to justify the trials to the higher powers in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It was for this book that Cotton found himself spit upon in the streets (and some annals of history) to the day of his death on Feb. 13th 1728.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nIncrease Mather\nINCREASE MATHER (1639-1723): Mather, an influential Boston minister and father of Cotton Mather, is credited with being a force for moderation throughout the Salem witchcraft trials and helping bring them to an end with the circulation of his Cases of Conscience on October 3, 1692. Increase Mather has drawn fire from some historians of the period for his hesitancy to take a firm stand against the trials and executions early in the summer of 1692. However, Mather\'s unique role as leading minister, President of Harvard College, and confidant of Governor William Phips placed him in the precarious position of contesting the witchcraft trials while supporting the judges. While his actions in 1692 were often self-contradictory, he was, according to Kenneth Murdock regarded as "an ally and leader of those whom we see as the most liberal of his time."\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nSamuel Parris\nOne of the most notorious personalities in Salem, the Rev. Samuel Parris represents to some the danger of religious power when wielded by self-centered and deceptive individuals. To others, his antipathy towards his opponents in Salem Village was simply a small factor in the larger picture of the Salem witch trials. In either case, the persecution of "witches" began in his household, and through that point extended deeply into the American psyche. One cannot help but question the amount of responsibility that Parris, who began preaching about the work of the Devil in his parish holds for the events of 1692.\n\nImages+\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nSamuel Willard\nSamuel Willard played an important role in the halting of the Salem witch trials. Born in 1640 to a privileged family, Willard had a long simmering devotion to the Puritan church, a devotion he would later cultivate at Harvard College. Despite his religious fervor, Willard appears to be man of uncommon calm, as he urged caution in the accusing and trying of witches. Willard also denounced spectral evidence, claiming that the devil could impersonate even the innocent by appearing in their shape. After the trials ended, Willard was to push hard for reconciliation between the pro-Parris and anti-Parris factions of Salem Village.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nSarah Bibber\n\n\nElizabeth Booth\n\n\nSarah Churchill\nSarah Churchill (or Churchwell), a 25 year-old woman originally from Maine, was both an accuser and a confessor during the Salem witchcraft crisis. She is most noted for the accusations of witchcraft against her abusive employer, the elderly George Jacobs Sr., and for her admission that her confession to witchcraft was a pretense to save herself from the gallows -- a strategy that succeeded.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nElizabeth Hubbard\nElizabeth Hubbard was seventeen in the spring of 1692 when she and three other girls started accusing people of witchcraft. Like many of the other "afflicted" girls in Salem Village, she was an orphan and lived with her great-aunt and uncle, Dr. William Giggs. Elizabeth played an active role throughout the trials as one of the leading accusers. Her afflictions, fits, trances and testimony all contributed to the conviction and execution of many of the nineteen executed innocent people.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nMercy Lewis\nMercy Lewis Born in Falmouth, Maine in 1675, Mercy Lewis lost both her parents to Indian attacks and became an orphan at a young age. Dislocated from her family, like many of the accusing girls in Salem Village, she resided first as a servant with Reverend George Burroughs and then later with the family of Thomas Putnam to whom she was distantly related. As a friend of Ann Putnam and the other girls involved in the witchcraft accusations, Mercy herself became one of the most consistent and vocal accusers during the 1692 witchcraft trials in Salem.\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nElizabeth Parris\nAt nine years old, Elizabeth Parris, daughter of Salem Village minister Rev. Samuel Parris, played a key role in the beginnings of the witchcraft trials. Curious to know her future marital status , Elizabeth, together with her cousin Abigail Williams, cautiously experimented with fortune telling. Her behavior led to the first three accusations of witches. Trying to shield the involvement of his immediate family, the Rev. Samuel Parris, took Abigail from home and placed her in the home of Stephen Sewall in Salem, where she eventually recovered. She could not have predicted that these innocent attempts at predicting the future would lead to the largest and most deadly witch-hunt in American history.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nAnn Putnam, Jr.\nAnn Putnam, Jr. played a crucial role in the witchcraft trials of 1692. She was twelve years old at the time, and she was one of the first to join Betty Parris and Abigail Williams as an "afflicted child". Though she is easily despised for her role as one of the most persistent accusers in the trials, it is important to view her in the context of her socially prominent family. Her mother was also afflicted, and her father and many other Putnams gave testimony against the accused during the trials. When attempting to make a judgment on Ann, it is important to remember that she was very young and impressionable and thus easily influenced by her parents and other adults. Fourteen years later she admitted that she had lied, deluded by the Devil.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nSusanna Sheldon\n\n\nMary Warren\nBorn twenty years before the Salem Witch Trials began, Mary Warren became one of the most rigorous accusers -- and also a defender and confessor, a unique role among the accusing girls of Salem Village. As the servant of John and Elizabeth Procter, opponents of the trials who thought that the accusers should be punished, Mary encountered much resistance from the two regarding her participation in the trials. Most significantly, Warren introduced the possibility of fraud on the part of the accusing girls when she stated that they "did but dissemble." Arthur Miller\'s play The Crucible focuses on this unique aspect of Mary Warren\'s behavior. After her own confession, Warren more actively participated in the accusations, including those against the Procters. She was released from jail in June, 1692.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nMary Walcott\nMary Walcott, the daughter of Jonathan Walcott, commander of the Village militia and the brother-in-law of Thomas Putnam, was a key accuser in the Salem Witch Trials. Walcott was closely related to the Thomas Putnam family; her aunt was Ann Putnam,Sr. and her cousin was Ann Putnam, Jr. Although Mary Walcott was one of the circle of accusing girls, by the end of the trials she had attracted sixteen spectral torturers.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nAbigail Williams\nAbigail Williams was one of the main accusers in the Salem Witch trials. The 11-year-old niece of Reverend Samuel Parris showed signs of fits and hysterics in mid-January 1692. She and her 9-year-old cousin Betty were the first two afflicted girls in Salem Village. Abigail gave formal testimony at 7 cases, and she was involved in as many as 17 capital cases.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nTituba\nTituba Indian holds one of the most infamous (yet still debated) places in the history of the Salem Witchcraft Trials. Tituba was an Indian slave in the service of Reverend Samuel Parris, in whose home the diagnosis of witchcraft was first made. She was the first accused (along with Sarah Osborne) and was also the first to confess. Tituba\'s confession set a precedent and pattern that would run the course of the trials -- accused witches confessed and then became accusers themselves, thereby validating the previous accusations and the need for continuing investigations and trials, as the court desired. Though Tituba was not executed for her participation as a "detestable Witch," she was forced to languish in jail for thirteen months after Parris refused to pay her imprisonment costs. She was finally freed from jail when an unknown person redeemed her jail fees and took her from the Village. Nothing is known about her life beyond Salem Village.\n\nImages+\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nAnn Dolliver\nThe deserted wife of William Dolliver of Gloucester and the daughter of respected Salem Town minister the Rev. John Higginson, Ann Higginson Dolliver was arrested for witchcraft on June 6, 1692 but was never convicted. Analysis of her role in the trials has been difficult until the recent discovery of the transcript of her courtroom examination that sheds new light on her case. Scholars also provide various socio-political or gender-based frameworks for understanding the Salem witch trials within which she can be viewed.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nPhilip English\nPhilip English, the most successful merchant in Salem Town, emigrated from Isle of Jersey as Philippe D\'Anglois in 1670. He rose out of obscurity to become the largest entrepreneur and ship owner in Salem, and he married into an established Salem merchant family. He and his wife were arrested of witchcraft in late April 1692, but both escaped to New York for the duration of the trials. No attempts were made to bring English back to face trial. During his hiding in New York, English\'s wealthy estate was pillaged at the hands of Sheriff Corwin, and little restitution was ever made for his losses.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nAbigail Faulkner\n\n\nMary Ireson\nMary Ireson is one of the minor characters of the Salem witch trials. However, from the one substantive document that has recently surfaced, we can gain insight into the often-unfair mechanisms of the witch trials court - especially how the female accusers\' courtroom behavior could sway a jury, and how petrified the accused "witches" must have been during their trials.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nMargaret Jacobs\nAlthough she was only seventeen at the time of the Salem Witch Trials, Margaret Jacobs knew that the safest way out of the witchcraft accusations directed at her was through confession. She employed this equation in her initial accusations against former minister of Salem Village, George Burroughs, and the patriarch of the Jacobs family, her own grandfather, George Jacobs, Sr. Although her accusations, among others, led to the execution of both men, it is not her accusations that make her case of interest. It is her eventual retraction of these accusations and voicing of her own conscience that make Jacobs an icon of strength and integrity. While other accusers escaped death by relentlessly accusing one person after another, Margaret Jacobs sat in jail facing death for her refusal to stand by her initial accusations and confession of witchcraft.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nIsrael Porter\n\n\nJoseph Putnam\n\n\nChildren\nThe witchcraft crisis in Essex County, Massachusetts in 1692 has long been known for its unusual list of accused witches. The high proportion of men accused of witchcraft in the crisis has been noted by historians for decades, as has the unusual preponderance of wealthy, influential citizens and upstanding church members. There is one atypical group of accused, however, who have been largely overlooked. During the course of the crisis, at least eight children under the age of twelve were accused of witchcraft, and most were indicted. This examination of the eight cases of young children who were accused as witches will provide a vantage point from which to examine the dynamics of family and community that shaped the witchcraft crisis.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nGloucester Women\nMost scholarship on the Salem Witchcraft crisis has focused on Salem Village and to some extent on Salem Town. This is hardly surprising, since the crisis started in Salem Village and these two communities, along with nearby Andover, produced the vast majority of witchcraft accusations and trials. However, other towns in Essex County also experienced witchcraft allegations, some of which produced trials and even executions. One of these towns was Gloucester.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nJohn Alden\nA member of the Boston elite, Captain John Alden was accused on May 28th, 1692 but avoided further proceedings on April 25, 1693 when he escaped from jail and fled to New York where several high-profile witchcraft defendants were welcomed and protected. Although the accusers knew him only by name, his profitable connections to Maine and involvement with the Indian Wars which orphaned several of the accusers likely contributed to the accusations against him.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nThomas Putnam\nAlthough Thomas Putnam\'s role in initiating legal proceedings has been generally recognized as important to the escalation of the witchcraft crisis in Salem in 1692, the immense influence Putnam had on the shape of the trials has not been widely recognized. Putnam was the father of Ann Putnam Jr., the most prolific accuser in the entire proceedings. Putnam’s importance is generally seen in the fact that he, along with other adults, gave his daughter’s accusations legal weight in first seeking warrants against the accused witches in February, 1692. Through his work in writing down the depositions of many of the "afflicted" girls in Salem village and his letters of encouragement to the judges, Putnam was one of the major advocates of the trials and sought to exert influence on the proceedings as one of the most prosperous residents and influential church members in Salem Village.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records\n\n\nDr. William Griggs\nDr. William Griggs of Salem Village, though not referred to by name in the court documents, is generally accepted by historians as the doctor who made the diagnosis that the afflictions of the girls in Salem village were caused by “an evil hand,” not by natural causes. His diagnosis triggered a sequence of events that began with the making of a witch cake and led to hundreds of accusations of witchcraft.\n\nFull Essay+\n\nFind in the Court Records',

The Essex County Archives Collection, under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Judicial Court, was deposited at the Essex Institute by the Supreme Court in December, 1980. The Essex Institute Collection is comprised of witchcraft documents found in several of the Institute's collections of family papers.\n\nBoth collections contain legal documents of the Salem Witchcraft Trials of 1692. They have been indexed by name for both plaintiffs and defendants. Transcriptions of these documents, as well as additional witchcraft documents held in other archives, were published in Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum's The Salem Witchcraft Papers (New York, DaCapo Press, 1971).\n\nRestrictions:\nNo portion of these documents may be reproduced without permission of the Director of the Essex Institute.\n\nProcessed and Indexed by: Donald Gleason, 1981.\n\n\nEnlarge\nManuscript\n\nEnlarge\nManuscript\nDocument: Abbot, Nehemiah Sr. v.

    content:
      '\nDays of Judgment\nReviewed By Sarah-Nell Walsh\n\nSalem Witch Trials in History and Literature\nAn Undergraduate Course, University of Virginia\nSpring Semester 2001\n\nDays of Judgment is an informative movie made on the tercentennial of the Salem Witchcraft trials in 1992. It is an accurate and fair portrayal of both the causes of the trials and the trial\'s consequences. It provides a broad historical overview with none of the commercial, trivial exaggeration that many have come to associate with Salem. Instead of using visuals from the town of Salem\'s commercial ventures, the film uses engravings, paintings, actual Salem documents, signatures of participants, and shots of Danvers town, the old Salem Village. It is well organized into thirteen segments that each deal with a different facet of the trial.\n\n"The Days of Judgment" is the title of the first segment, which is a historical overview of the period leading up to the trials. Stephen Nissenbaum criticizes other historians for looking at the trials in a vacuum and ignoring important events that led up to them. He outlines a more general version of what can be found in his book Salem Possessed. He speaks of a village facing a changing economic situation, forming alliances, and battling for independence against Salem town.\n\n"Life in the Village" speaks further to the conflict and uncertainty which the villagers faced every day. Richard Godbeer explains Salem\'s conflicts with political officials, Native Americans, and Quakers. Since the royal charter had recently been revoked, the Massachusetts colony did not have a legal form of government when the first accusations occurred. At the same time, the villagers faced the perceived malevolent threats of Quakers and Indians, which they saw as strongly linked to witchcraft.\n\n"A Divided Community" speaks to the interpersonal conflicts which the town faced during this time of even larger uncertainty. Nissenbaum explains that there was an independence movement to create a new meeting house separate from Salem town. This hope for separation led to the development of factions within the Village. Barbara Dailey explains the dynamics of a strongly hierarchical society, where your rank and station was visible every day in your dress, seating in church, housing, title, and gender. Richard Trask highlighted the idea of the meeting house as the civic center where all important town proceedings took place. And, David Hall introduced the idea of the meeting house as symbolic space. The meeting house was seen as the garden amidst the wilderness. It represented peace, safety, and security. Hall also stressed the idea that the 17th century was alive with "wonder." "Wonder" is a term that encompasses many different phenomena, but mainly has to do with God or the devil sending humans messages through invisible means. Godbeer describes several forms of magic. He believes that lay folk made a distinction between divination, counter-magic, and malevolent magic or witchcraft. Even though ministers saw all forms of magic as the devil\'s tool and preached against it, many people practiced some form of magic and believed that humans could wield that power without the devil\'s help.\n\n"The Crime of Maleficia" is defined as harmful magic (the use of supernatural powers to bring about harm) and can involve "diabolism," which is the worship of the devil. It is estimated that between 1450 and 1700, one hundred thousand people were executed for witchcraft and eighty percent of them were women. Hall believes that the common lay person was concerned with maleficia, whereas officials and clergy people were concerned with diabolism. Brian Levack believes that was because diabolism threatened Christian civilization. The first book written on the subject of witchcraft was called Maleficarum, published in 1486 by the Dominicans as a handbook for investigating and prosecuting witches. It concluded that women are more easily drawn to evil and led to widespread witch hunts in England. There was a big difference between the witch hunts on continental Europe and those in England. On the continent, witchcraft was considered to be heresy against the church and punishable by burning, whereas in England it was civil crime punishable by hanging. The English tradition is obviously what colonial America was following.\n\n"The Cosmic Struggles of Samuel Parris" follows the man that every colonial historian loves to hate. In 1689, Samuel Parris arrived in Salem Village. Nissenbaum describes how this was a last resort for Parris after failing as a merchant. The arrival of Parris intensified the division in the community into pro- and anti-Parris factions. Nissenbaum describes how Parris saw this not as a political struggle, but as a cosmic division between forces of good (pro-Parris) and evil (anti-Parris). Unfortunately, Puritan culture did not have a language for legitimate opposition to authority and Parris could not separate the personal, political, or religious.\n\n"Affliction" gives a brief overview of the breakout of affliction in Samuel Parris\' house. It briefly describes the divination techniques which the girls were using to try and decipher the trades of their future husbands, including the "Venus glass" (an egg white suspended in water). When the Village doctor, William Griggs, was unable to find a diagnosis for the girls\' fits, he concluded witchcraft.\n\n"Tituba" was Samuel Parris\' slave and has also been the subject of much folklore. She was probably of Native American descent and was acquired on one of Parris\' trips to Barbados. Although tradition has it that Tituba taught young Abigail Williams and Betty Parris about the occult, Elaine Breslaw explains that there is no evidence to support that theory since they were using traditional English divination techniques. Since Tituba confessed, her role was defined by what she had to say. She gave a full detailed story which many people believed and has been incorporated into common folklore about witches.\n\n"The Devil Hath Been Raised Amongst Us" reminds viewers that the first three arrests did not end the torment of the afflicted and many more people were arrested as a result. They detail the story of Rebecca Nurse\'s examination and the role which the afflicted girls play in this unfolding drama.\n\n"The Accused" focuses obviously on the people who were indicted and convicted of witchcraft. Seventy-five percent of the people accused at Salem were women. Barbara Daily draws the conclusion that socially independent women who were not under the supervision of men were the most likely to be accused. These included healers, women who were scold and mutterers, and women who collected herbs. She believes this was partly because women were feared for their powerful biological capabilities. Hall believes that social quarrels with subsequent misfortune led to witchcraft accusations. Her example of this prototype is the fact that Rebecca Nurse was accused of witchcraft by Ann Putnam Jr. following a property dispute between the Putnam\'s and the Nurses.\n\n"Spectral Evidence and the Law" examines the process by which witches were prosecuted, and progresses from a complaint to arrest to examination. Accusers had to provide evidence that the accused made a pact with the devil. Sufficient evidence often led to an indictment. Levack further adds that the accusers had to prove a diabolical compact between the devil and the accused. There were two legal ways of proving this compact: confession or two witnesses had to testify that she performed an act which implied a compact with the devil. Because of this strict burden of proof, very few people were convicted of witchcraft before 1692. In 1692, they accepted many different forms of proof as valid. The afflicted girls gave the most damaging proof of witchcraft in their spectral evidence of torment. Even at the time, there was much disagreement as to its validity.\n\n"The Court of Oyer and Terminer," meaning "to hear and to determine," was set up by Governor Phips to hear the witchcraft trials. The court records are our best guide as to what happened. There are over five hundred documents, including indictments, warrants, depositions, and verbatim transcriptions of courtroom hearings. None of the judges had formal legal training. Unlike previous witchcraft trials, confessed witches were not executed immediately whereas those found guilty were. Dailey explains that confessed witches were given time to examine their souls and prepare for death before they were executed. The trials ended before executions of confessed witches took place. Because of this, the relatives of the accused placed a great deal of pressure on them to confess in order the buy time and put of execution. When the witch hunt engulfed the town of Andover, over fifty people confessed to spare their lives.\n\n"The End of the Trials" basically lays out the chronology for the end of the trials. On September 8, 1692 the last eight people were hanged for witchcraft. By October, the afflicted girls were accusing people from prominent families, including the wife of Governor Phips. The Court of Oyer and Terminer came under attack. Increase Mather denounced spectral evidence and declared that it was better that ten witches escape than one be condemned. "Confessed" witches began recanting their confessions. Godbeer explains that October 12 was the end of imprisonment for witchcraft and October 15 was the date of dissolution for Oyer and Terminer. In November, a new court was assembled and by January it had heard 52 cases. The court acquitted all but three, and those three people were pardoned by the Governor. It proved very difficult to convict witches without the use of spectral evidence. In 1696, many jurors apologized and in 1706, Ann Putnam Jr. admits that she had been deluded by the devil. Healing came slowly to Salem Village. In 1752, they won their struggle for independence and became Danvers town.\n\n"1692 Remembered" addresses the question of what the Salem trials have come to represent. Many view the trials as a symbol of intolerance, repression, and injustice. Arthur Miller used the metaphor of the Salem trials to talk about the Red Hunt in his 1953 play, The Crucible. Brian Levack sees the trials as a warning that justice can always be miscarried when authority becomes determined to prosecute non-conformists and political enemies, especially when the community is behind the persecutions.\n\nBack to Scholarship\n\n© Copyright 2002 by Benjamin Ray and The Rector and Visitors of the\nUniversity of Virginia',

      "\nHome\nArchives\nBooks & Diaries\nDocuments\nMaps\nPeople\nTo John Cotton DI/AAS August 5, 1692\nAugust 5, 1692\nReverend Sir,\n\nOur good God is working of miracles. Five witches were lately executed, impudently demanding of God a miraculous vindication of their innocency. Immediately upon this, our God miraculously sent in five Andover witches, who made a most ample, surprising, amazing confession of all their villainies, and declared the five newly executed to have been of their company, discovering many more, but all agreeing in Burroughs being their ringleader, who, I suppose, this day receives his trial at Salem, whither a vast concourse of people is gone, my father this morning among the rest. Since those, there have come in other confessors; yea, they come in daily. About this prodigious matter my soul has been refreshed with some little short of miraculous answers of prayer, which are not to be written; but they comfort me with a prospect of a hopeful issue.\n\nThe whole town yesterday turned the lecture into a fast, kept in our meeting-house; God give a good return. But in the morning we were entertained with the horrible tidings of the late earthquake at Jamaica, on the 7th of June last. When, on a fair day, the sea suddenly swelled, and the earth shook and broke in many places; and in a minute�s time, the rich town of Port-Royal, the Tyrus of the whole English America, but a very Sodom for wickedness, was immediately swallowed up, and the sea came rolling over the town. No less than seventeen-hundred souls of that one town are missing, besides other incredible devastations all over the island, where houses are demolished, mountains overturned, rocks rent, and all manner of destruction inflicted. The Non-conformist minister there escaped wonderfully with his life. Some of our poor New England people are lost in the ruins, and others have their bones broke. Forty vessels were sunk�namely all whose cables did not break; but no New England ones. Behold, an accident speaking to all our English America. I live in pains, and want your prayers.\n\nBestow them, dear Sir, on Your,",

      "\nIATH takes scholarship into the 21st century\nBy Jon Bowen, A&S Online, September 2003\nOn September 18, 1692, Giles Cory was \"pressed to death\" after being accused of witchcraft. While all the other men and women who died in the Salem Witch Trials were hanged, Cory refused a trial by jury and thus got the dreaded sentence of peine forte et dure , which calls for rocks to be piled on top of the accused until he expires under the load. In Cory's case, it took two days. Obstinate to the end, his last words were, \"More weight!\"\n\nTwenty years ago, a scholar digging into Cory's life and death would've had to trudge all over the Northeast to visit the half-dozen libraries and historical societies that house the myriad documents, maps and images related to the Salem Witch Trials.\n\nScholars of today just visit Benjamin Ray's website . Ray, working through U.Va.'s Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH), has created a digital documentary archive and transcription project that gathers and centralizes data on the Salem Witch Trials for students, scholars and witchcraft aficionados everywhere. \"The computer is your collaborative research environment par excellence,\" Ray said. With the Salem Witch Trials project, \"You have people getting in this research sandbox, in a moderated way, and getting excited about advancing a scholarly project.\"\n\nThe players in Ray's sandbox include Bernard Rosenthal, an English professor at the University of Binghamton who serves as editor-in-chief of transcriptions; a team of managers, editors and assistants working at universities in the United States, Sweden and Finland; and the technical experts on IATH's staff who do the behind-the-scenes work that makes the website run.  \n\nThe Salem Witch Trials website is just one of the jewels in IATH's crown. Other research projects sponsored by the Institute include Ed Ayers' The Valley of the Shadow ; Stephen Railton's Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture ; Jerome McGann's Rossetti Archive ; as well as more than 40 other digital projects, in various stages of completion, covering music, linguistics, ethics, architecture and more.\n\nRead More\n\nHome | Introduction | Press Archive | Overview",

      "\nHome\nArchives\nBooks & Diaries\nDocuments\nMaps\nPeople\nTo John Cotton Holmes/BPL October 20, 1692\nOctober 20, 1692\nMy kindest and dearest Uncle,\n\n[Mentions sending along a book and invites Cotton�s comments.] There are fourteen worthy ministers that have newly set their hands unto a book now in the press, containing Cases of Conscience about witchcrafts. I did, in my conscience, think that as the humors of this people now run, such a discourse going alone would not only enable our witch-advocates very learnedly to cavil and nibble at the late proceedings against the witches, considered in parcels, while things as they lay in bulk, with their whole dependences, were not exposed; but also everlastingly stifle any further proceedings of justice, and more than so, produce a public and open contest with the judges, who would (tho� beyond the intention of the worthy author and subscribers) find themselves brought unto the bar before the rashest Mobile.\n\nFor such cases, and for one more, I did with all the modesty I could use, decline setting my hand unto the book, assigning this reason: that I had already a book in the press which would sufficiently declare my opinion; and such a book, too, as had already passed the censure of the hand which wrote what was then before us.\n\nWith what sinful and raging asperity I have been since treated, I had rather forget than relate. Although I challenged the fiercest of my accusers to find the thousandth part of one wrong step taken by me in all these matters, except it were my use of all humble and sober endeavors to prevent such a bloody quarrel between Moses and Aaron as would be Bitterness in the latter end; no other fault has yet been laid before me. At last I have been driven to say, I will yet be more vile! and quoting Math V 9 I have concluded, So, I shall not want a father!\n\nSince the trial of these unworthy treats, the persons that have used them have endeavored such expressions of sweetness toward me as may make me satisfaction. But for the great slander with which they have now filled the country against me, That I run against my own father and all the ministers in the country, merely because I run between them when they are like mad men running against one another, they can make me no reparation; however my God will!\n\n[Expresses confidence that God will bless the purpose of his book]\n\nMy friends have now happily gained a point which has been long wished for; even for me to become unconsidered. I confess, things become every day more and more so circumstanced, as if my opportunities of serving my neighbors were after a sort expiring; alas, that I have made no better a use of them, while I had them! I seem now to have little to do, but to die; and oh blessed be the free-grace of God, by whose help, I hope, I can do that! [Asks him to write.] God preserve you, and all yours, from a crafty, busy, prevailing devil. Farewell.\n\nAnd think on, Your honest cousin,",

Ps. I.\n\nThe Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, untill I make thine enemies thy footstool.\n\nDoctr. Our once humbled, wounded, & bruised Mediator, has long since been exalted, not only by a Glorious Resurrection from the Grave, & and also a Glorious Ascension into Heaven, but also by a Glorious Session at the Right hand of God. Here it was enquired (1) What is the Session of Christ at the Right hand of God (2) When did this Session begin, & how long shall it continue? (3) Last: What are the Fruits of this Session? (An) The fruits & benefits hereof belong partly to Christs Sacerdotal Office; & partly to Christs Kingly Office (1) The great benefit which ariseth from Christs Session at the Right hand of God, as to his Sacerdotal Office, is his Intercession for Believers.\n\npage: 133\nOf Christs Glorious Session\n\nIntersession for Believers\n\n8 Rom. 34.\n\nHere these things may be enquired into\n\n1. With whom Christ dos Intercede?\n\n2. After what manner dos Christ Intercede?\n\n3. Last: Whither Christ dos Intercede alone?\n\n1. Q. With whom Christ dos Intercede?\n\nAn: For answer hereto, we must Note, that to Intercede is to have some Plea put in, or preferred to another by a third Person: so that here are Three Persons to be considered in this Intercession\n\n1. There is the Offended Person: And that is God. God is angry: He is displeased, & incensed.\n\n2. There is the Offending Person: And that is Man: yea all Mankind; the whole Race of Apostate Adam, as such. Even the very Elect, are by nature dead in sins & trespasses. Offending Persons, & so by nature children of wrath, God is offended with them. 2. Eph. 1.3. 7. Ps 11\n\n3. Last: There is the Interceding Person: And that is Christ Jesus, who steps in between the justly Offended Person, God, & the unjustly Offending Person, Man, to make Peace between both. 1. Tim. 2. 5. There is One Mediatour between God &, the men, Christ Jesus. God being now offended cannot now speak one good word to us but by Christ: And we being the Offending Persons, dare not look up to God for favour, but thro Christ. Christ Intercedes with the Father, as being the first Person in the sacred Trinity, who being once appeased together with him the Son: & Holy Spirit also are appeased: So that his Intercession is directed to the whole Trinity, immediately to the first Person, & then in him also to the rest.\n\n2. Q. After what manner dos Christ Intercede wth ye Father?\n\n1. An. Negatively: Not by any external prayers, nor by prostration of himself, or falling down upon his knees, as we do, & he also was want to do, whilst in ye state of his humiliation, as we read. 26. Matt. 39. 22. Luke. 41 He kneeled down & prayed. Not so now\n\n2. An.: Affirmatively.\n\n1. Christ appeaers before the face of his Father & presents him with the inestimable worth & vallue of his Sufferings.\n\npage: 134\nAt the Right hand of God\n\nThe worth of Souls, is above all the world. Much more valluable must be that price, by which such precious Souls are purchased. The Sufferings of Christ are speaking Sufferings. 12. Heb. 24. It is called the blood of God. 20. Acts. 28. And therefore must needs be infinitely valuable. Men highly vallue their own blood: Nay God sets an high price upon mans blood: How much more will he prize his own blood? As Christs was by communication of Properties.\n\n2. Christ intercedes by his expressing his will & desire to the Father. He pleads as. 17. Joh. 4. Father, I have Glorifyd thee on the earth. I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. q.d. Father, in order to the Salvation of a certain number of poor lost father Mankind, thou didst require my assuming of sinful flesh, & perfect obedience both active & passive &c. Father, I have done as thou didst require. Well, & what then? Why then sais he I require that these I have suffered for have the benefit of it. 24. v. of that. 17. John. Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me be w'th where I am &c. Man by the Fall was mortally wounded: By the suffering of Christ a Restorative Plaister was made; but now Christs Intercession is as it were an application of that Plaister.\n\n3. Q. Last: Whither Christ does Intercede alone\n\nAn: Yea, verily; for the Scripture attests not mention of any other Intecessors. As for the Holy Angels, the Scripture attests no such thing of them. And as for the Saints in Heaven they have no knowledge of our private state 63. Isa. 16.\n\npage: 135\nOf Christs Glorious Session\n\n& therefore are uncapable to Intercede for us. True it is the Saints on Earth ought to intercede for one [an]other, but yet improperly, For he only properly can be said to intercede for an other\n\n1. Who brings forth & offers somthing of his own Sufficient worth, price, & vallue, as that he, he petitions to, or intercede with should an injustice answer his request for ye sake thereof.\n\n2. All this is to be done by him that would be accounted an Inercessor in his own Name.\n\nBut now is this the Prerogative only of Christ Jesus, both to Intercede in his own Name, & upon the account of his Merit.\n\nSo much for the blessed fruit of Christs sitting at the Right hand of God with respect to his Priestly office, namely his Intercession for all his Elect.\n\nConco. 4a}\n\nAfternoon of the same day\n\n(2) Another great benefit which ariseth from Christs sitting at the Right hand of the Father, belongs to his Kingly Office, & consists of two things.\n\n1. In his Government of his Church\n\n2. In his defending of it against its enemies.\n\nI. Then Christ sits at the Right hand of God the Father, as Lord & King to Govern his Church. Indeed he has the Rule & Government of the of the whole world. 28. Matt. 18. All Power is given unto me in Heaven & in Earth. But his special Government is exercised towards his Church. As Joseph when exalted from a Prison, he had the Rule of all Egypt but he took special care of his Brethren. So here. Now Christ governs his Church by External means, & by Internal means.\n\n1. By External means, namely by his Word & Rod. By the preaching of the word, whereby he gives us his Laws: & by afflictions whereby he brings us\n\npage: 136\nAt the Right hand of God\n\nback, when we have strayed from them. 119. Ps. 67.\n\n2. By internal means, namrely by his hold Spirit. This is called his strongest Rod (or Sceptre) verse after text. The Lord shall send the Rod of thy strength out of Zion. i.e., his holy word which is full of might when set on the Spirit. Hince it is called the Power of God. 1. Ro. 16\n\nMore, particularly the order of this Government is after this manner\n\nBy the praching of the word, Christ gathers a Church by separating of the Elect from the rest of Mankind as his peculiar Flock. 15. Joh. 19. I have chosen you out of the world. i.e. I have separated you from the world. Now by what means is this Separation made? Why it is by the Preaching of the word, that a Church is born & propogated. This is the way men are born again. 3. joh. 3 2. Acts. 41.47 4. Ch. 4 & 6. 7. And for this purpose Christ hath given Ministers extraordinary & ordinary, fitted & qualified for this work. 4. Eph. 8. 4. 12. 13. By adding to the Preaching of the word the efficacy of his Spirit, by which means the dark minds of the Elect are enlightened, & their hard hearts are softened. It is said of the Apostles that they went forth preaching of the word, & the Lord worked with them. ult. Mark. ult. i.e. both with Preachers, & Hearers. An instance you have in Lydia. 16. Acts. 14. Hince all saving profit by the word is justly attributed unto God. 1. Cor. 3. 5. 6. 7. We our selves, as the Children of Isreal of old, are abundantly prone to wander in the wilderness of this world, were it not for Christ as a pillar of fire, & a cloud, by his word & spirit, giving before us, as our Leader into the Heavenly Canaan. 30. Isa. 20. 21. --- Thine ears shall hear a word behind three saying this is the way &cc.\n\n3. Last: By exercising his Church in Spiritual obedience by manifold & various troubles, afflictions, & persecutions in this world, even as Earthly good Princes chasten the transgressors of their laws to bring them to obsdience: Christ hath placed his Church in this world, as in a Sea, & suffereth\n\npage: 137\nOf Christs Glorious Session\n\nmany storms& tempests to threaten its Shipwreck, whilst in the mean time he himself seems to be fast asleep., as 8. Matt. 23. 24. Now this Christ doth chiefly for these three Reasons.\n\n1. R. To humble this Church of their sins. The Church of God whilst militant is not without sin: well now by sore afflictions, & cross providences. Christ will bring her sins to Remembrance of them. 5. Lam. 16. The crown has fallen from our head: wo unto us that we have sinned. They mourn more for their sin, than for the loss of their crown.\n\n2. R. To make his Church more watchful against sin. Even as Parents, seeing their young children over bold with Fire, orwater, they bring their children neaer to the fire, & hold them over ye water , as if they would burn them, or drown them whereas they intend nothing less, only to awe them & fright them, that they may hereafter keep father off: Why so our Lord Jesus seeing us often over bold & venturesome upon sin, & suffers us almost to fall even as it were over hear and ears for a time seems to desert, & all is out of love to prevent a total fall, as in David & Peter.\n\n3. R. Last:To make us more watchfull to duty. Hince afflictions are compared to a hedge of thorns. 2. Hos. 6. Now unruly creatures when they endeavour to break the bounds but meet with pricking briers & thorns, this will cause them to decist: So here. Even famous Paul had need of such a smarting Providence to keep within the divine bounds of humility. 2. Cor. 12. 7.\n\nII.As Christ Governs his Church, as he sits as King, sitting at the Right hand of God the Father, so also He as King defends his Church against all ruining attemps and purposes. Now here a twofold action as of Christ\n\npage: 138\nAt the Right hand God\n\nas King Falls under our considertaion. Namely\n\n1. The deportment of Christ, as King, sitting at the Right hand of the Father, with reference to the defense of his Church\n\n2. depa rtment of Christ, as King, sitting at the Right hand of ye Father, with reference to the punishing of the Enimies of his Church.\n\nI. Then Christ, as King, sitsat the Right hand of the Father for the defense of his Church, against all the madness, rage, & fury, of their enimies. The Church is separated from the world: They are new-born, new creatures, have other aims, end, & principles, different from, yea contrary to the men of the world: Hince ariset hatred & persecution from those they act contrary to. As long as there is contrary Seed, a Seed of the Woman, & a Seed of the Serpent, there will be opposition, more or less, open or secret. 4. Gal. 27. Hince it is that not seldom great hatred ariseth from the nearest Relations. 13 Mark. 12. 13. Well but then, you may say, what will become of the Church, for that is but a small part of the world. 12. Luke. 32. Oh, as little part as they are, they are well enough, secure enough. Their King Christ takes special care of them. 27. Isa. 3. Lest any hurt it, I will keep it night & day. Now Christ defends his Church two ways\n\n1. By supplying them, with renewed strength suitable to their trials. Christ having begun a new work, it is the main drift of the Devil to pull it all down, but Christ will see to the promoting of it. 1. Philip. 6. He yt hath begun good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ. He gives renewed strength. 1. Cor. 11. As in those worthies. 11. Heb. p totum\n\nBy hampering & fettering their enemies &c. As we see in the case of the Jews in Esthers days\n\nChrist defends his Church against three great enemies\n\n1. Against inward enemies in their own souls: their own remaining lusts. 7. Rom. 24.25.\n\n2. Against furious & fiery persecutions. Hince the Church is compared to a burning bush. 3. Ex. 2. And. 12. Rev. 14 ad finem\n\nLast: Against the power of Death. 1. Cor. 15. 25. 26. 5. John. 28. 29.\n\n2. Christ as King sits at the Right hand of the Father for the punishment of the enemies of his Church. Both these are the properties of a God King &c\n\npage: 139\nOf Christs Glorious Session\n\n1. The Devil the grand enemy of the Church, Christ afflicts him by hindering the success of his attempts: as in Peters case. 22. Luke. 31. 32. He binds his strong man armed &c.\n\n2. Wicked & Rebrobate men (the assistants of Satan to afflict the Church) he punisheth them by hardening of their proud & inveterate hearts. i.e. by giving them up to ye hardness of their own hearts, as we see in Pharoah, so yt they run themselves voluntarily & merrily into ye Sea of destruction. Sometimes they fall into utter desperation as bloody Saul, & treacherous Ahitophel & Judas &c.\n\nBut by reason of the Cold so much shall suffice for the doctrinal handling of this point.",

      "\n\n“The soul-killing witches that deform the body,” Shaks\n\nExplanation: The caption under the engraving is an aptly chosen phrase from Shakespeare’s play The Comedy Errors (Act I, scene 2). The words are spoken by a character who fears that witches are deceiving and cheating him. These fears turn out to be groundless, involving mistaken identities among several characters. The caption is appropriate to Calef’s book which is an attack on the Rev. Cotton Mather’s defense of the Salem witch trials, especially his approval of the use of spectral evidence, which was the basis of the witchcraft convictions. Specters of those accused of witchcraft were said to cause the fits and bodily contortions experienced by the accusers. Later, the spectral visions of the accusers were determined to be delusions caused by the devil, thus ending the witch trials.
